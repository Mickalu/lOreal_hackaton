12641,12641,Is Tom Friedman a real person Or is he a simulation Are he and David Brooks mere subroutines dredged from the source code of the late David Broder Whatever the case may be Friedman has perpetrated another New York Times column and for my sins I was sent to read it You will never guess what it s about It s about leaving behind hyperpartisanship They are all about leaving behind hyperpartisanship Only this one is about how Joe Biden can really prove he s a leader worthy of taking on Donald Trump Because this is a time for leadership and a time to leave hyperpartisanship behind once and for all Friedman notes that Joe Biden not being actually in charge of anything except his own campaign at the moment has a bit of a problem showing he s a leader right now but he could easily demonstrate what kind of leader he would be ideally by getting all his ideas from Tom Friedman Jesus Tommy we thought you wanted to beat Trump Anyhow Friedman thinks Biden ought to go much farther than just naming his vice presidential choice He needs to be bold He needs to take a risk He needs to embrace Mitt Romney Yes really At the Democratic convention he needs to name not just his vice president but his entire cabinet And it needs to be a totally different kind of cabinet a national unity cabinet from Democrats on the Bernie Sanders left to Republicans on the Mitt Romney right Why Because while most people are playing nice right now managing this virus the wreckage pain and anger it will leave behind will require megadoses of solidarity and healing from the top In short if this is not the time to leave behind the hyperpartisanship that has made it nearly impossible for us to do anything big and hard for two decades then when America you have no idea how difficult it was not to just go with Tom Friedman Wants To Do Something Big And Hard for the headline but these are difficult times and we must move beyond such impulses Still for yet another Tom Friedman Is More Sensibly Centrist Than You column Friedman manages not to be too excessively annoying Editrix still fuming DISAGREE As ever he s moderately annoying And as ever what s most annoying is his penchant for acting as if Today s Hyperpartisan Excesses were something both parties routinely indulged in as if the Stephen Miller Steve King Louie Gohmert wackaloons were equally balanced out by Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and the Squad One side wants a white ethnostate the other thinks we need a higher marginal tax rate on the very rich Both sides aside Friedman at least lays out some non terrible criteria for his Fantasy Cabinet League To be a member of Joe Tom Friedman Biden s Cabinet nominees must hold certain minimal values They d have to agree that science is real and not just around the coronavirus but around climate change which is the next train coming at us Yes the link is to another Friedman column Wonkette takes no issue with excessive self linking If they held office during Coronapalooza they d have had to take the public health threat seriously and acted accordingly They would have to be willing to consider extraordinary measures to help the poor the unemployed and the bankrupted following the crisis No Grover Norquist government drowners Friedman allows much leeway though calling for a healthy balance between the public and private sectors This one s a beaut They have to want to extend health care to every American Oh Medicare for All Cool Haha no not that not that at all for starters by strengthening Obamacare and adding a public option Thomas Friedman just takin a walk on the mild side Still not a terrible starting point although all of them are a bit like what Cory Booker says about listing rejoin Paris as part of a climate plan That s only enough to get you through the door now what s your policy Then Friedman gets into his list of Cabinet choices some of which are not really Cabinet positions but it s his dream so who are we to complain if there s no such thing as a Secretary of Cupcakes His picks really do range from the Bernie Sanders left to the Mitt Romney right quite literally since he wants Romney for secretary of State Which we suppose he would not suck at as long as he s not allowed to drive in France And as UN ambassador Friedman names Sanders endorser Alexandria Ocasio Cortez which seems odd I am sure she could do that because she s hella smart but of her many interests foreign policy does not exactly spring to top of mind A lot of Friedman s choices feel just as arbitrary Since Friedman love object Michael Bloomberg can not be president let us make him Treasury secretary Bill Gates for Health and Human Services because he has a foundation I guess And Elizabeth Warren for a position that Friedman just made up secretary of oversight for the trillions of dollars in emergency coronavirus spending to make sure it s done fairly and productively Similarly Friedman would appoint Walmart CEO Doug McMillon as Secretary of national infrastructure rebuild which he helpfully explains is a new cabinet post Putting the Walmart CEO in charge of infrastructure or anything in which people are supposed to not only get paid but get paid a prevailing wage also set your editrix s hair on fire she reminds me And so on Al Gore to run the EPA Sure that s nice Merrick Garland who never got his Supreme Court seat for attorney general Running the entire Justice Department does not seem at all like the same thing In Thomas Friedman s brain say Kamala Harris does not exist for AG or veep The cast of characters mostly white except one black person who is a former American Express CEO and mostly rich too often feels like an excuse for Friedman to call attention to people in civil society he thinks we should know about like his choice of Laurene Powell Jobs as Education secretary instead of like someone with an actual career in teaching or running giant bureaucracies But Powell Jobs has funded some gee whiz educational projects so in she goes sort of a Betsy DeVos of the leftish side but not evil we assume or dumb we also assume Sen Chris Murphy D Connecticut nails the problem

5326,5326,Dance Structure for slaves font Here are some points to look out for while creating your dances Try to keep your dances between to posts long You do not wish bore a Master by dancing forever and a day nor do you wish to have the dance over before it seems to have started Too short of a dance may seem like little effort was put into it Dances are not just movement They are expressions of emotion You should remember to add feelings and music into the poses while you dance Give the Master something to focus on remember feel Do not cut and paste or use macros this is the sign of a lazy slave and also does not allow for changes to be easily made What will you do if something happens during the dance that will interrupt it I E A fight breaks out an over enthusiastic Master decides to screw the dance and toss you over his shoulder Net split An assassination All kinds of things can happen I recommend that you watch the screen do not just go onto autopilot Change your dance depending on what is happening in the room Try to seperate your poses with something like a BOLDED word or a small seperator like ~ ~ This makes it easier for all to read One last thing Remember that those who watch do not read minds Try to be clear on what is it you are doing Have a definite beginning where are you what are you doing and a definite closing Scripting the Dance OK The actual scripting of a dance It can be difficult to put your ideas to paper You may have a lot of vague ideas and a basic timeline and order of events That is all you need Scripting a dance is like painting Yes I knows that it sounds silly but it works We will be scripting a classic Pole Dance FIRST sketch the idea out on the page jot down your random thoughts free form Go to pole describe your outfit wait for music Music begins twirl about pole mimic lashing Repent beg forgiveness Pole becomes Master pressing to it Submitting longing for his touch hips moving move about pole caressing body heat Faster harder Climax End post The thing to remember with your free form thoughts It is NOT written in stone Half the time they may not match the jotted thought SECOND begin to fill in the descriptions of the dance adding in color and spark bring the dance to life and setting the mood of the dance Go to pole desc outfit wait for music becomes girl moves to the whipping pole in the middle of the sand pit She tosses her hair from her face eyes bright with excitement She smoothes her hands over her silks and lifts her arms up to grasp the chain as if bound for punishment ready for the music to begin THIRD Fill in the description with appropriate adjectives polish the pose She moves as graceful as a prowling feline to the whipping pole in the middle of the sand pit She tosses her mane of raven hair from her face dark eyes bright with excitement Smoothing her silks over the curves of her female body she lifts her arms up to grasp the chain as if bound for punishment ready for the music to begin You may find that one post with not be enough to fill out one of your jotted thoughts That is fine Simply break it up into two or more posts But be careful to not get bogged down in too much detail Let each post flow from one to another Always read your dance to yourself out loud See if it makes sense and flows together You may have to add an transitional post to link two major posts together Structure of the Dance Think of the dance as a story You are trying to express yourself tell your story for all who watch to see feel and understand It is important to have the following parts to a dance Beginning This is a clear sign that the dance has begun girl moves as graceful as a prowling feline to the whipping pole in the middle of the sand pit She tosses her mane of raven hair from her face dark eyes bright with excitement Smoothing her silks over the curves of her female body she lifts her arms up to grasp the chain as if bound for punishment ready for the music to begin Build up The dance is a story there needs to be a definite progression of events For example With a Pole Dance the dance can start as a punishment moving to begging for forgiveness moving to offering oneself for the pleasure of the Master moving to pleasure and joy and finally to a conclusion With a Veil Dance there is a definite progression as the veils are shed from the body You could tell the story of a FreeWoman made slave or of a slave coming out of her shell into her full sexuality veils shed like a cocoon Climax The pinnacle of the Dance where the story of the Dance is realized This is usually one or two posts from the end of the dance with the last posts to wrap up the dance Some examples Pole Dance The Joy of finally pleasuring the Master Veil Dance The point where the last Veil is shed Submission Dance The point where the slave submits to the Master Capture Dance The point where the slave is actually captured End Post This is a clear sign that the dance has ended This girl likes to nadu bowing her head in respect for those who watched the dance and to name the dance girl shifts from the pole crawling a bit away from it where she kneels tall chin lifted proudly dark eyes lowered hands resting with palms facing the moons of Gor upon thighs parted wide to display her body She bows her head in respect to those who have watched as her Pole Dance comes to its conclusion Final thoughts on scripting a dance Always dance from the heart Dance what you feel and describe it Let others know your passions your joy your pain and sorrow A dance is to affect all who watch drawn them sweet nectar for the taking Be original A dance is a personal expression You have no need to copy another even if the dance has been danced a thousand times before Make the dance your own claim it body and soul Be sexy Face it girls that is why the Masters watch They like to see the female expression of sexuality You can be as blatant or innuendo ish as you like I prefer more the innuendo but there are times for the blatant in your face lustful posts On the practical side Spell check Nothing will distract more from a dance then badly spelled words Reality Continuity check is what you dance possible Do not be on your knees in one post and leaping in the next unless you write that you are rising from your knees to leap into the air Remember no one is a mind reader they cannot see the dance that is in your head Read your dance out loud to yourself Make sure it flows smoothly and makes sense Do not be afraid to go back add things or subtract them A dances is a living thing forever being modified Show your sisters and get their opinion if you think you need help But be warned if you ask for an opinion expect an honest answer and accept the fact that if your sisters do not like the dance it is only the dance they are critiquing not you personally This is please your Master None of what I have said matters one wit if it does not please the Master you dance for Tailor your dances to suit your Master If he is a leg man more leg posts if he wishes you to touch yourself caress your body more Modify all the suggestions I have said to fit the audience you will be dancing for Finally have fun and be yourself Dance Explanation Belt Dance The belt dance is a dance developed and made famous by Port Kar dancing girls The belt dance is performed with a Warrior She now writhed on the furs at his feet moving as though being struck with a whip A white silken cord had been knotted about her waist in this cord was thrust a narrow rectangle of white silk perhaps about two feet long The dance receives its name from the fact that the girl s head is not suppose to rise above the Warrior s belt but only purists concern themselves with such niceties wherever the dance is performed however it is imperative that the girl never rise to her feet Assassin of Gor p Chain Dance A girl is chained to a stake by a warrior with the chain interwoven from the ko lar of her neck through the wrists and down to her ankle cuffs by ten feet of play between the slave and the driven stake The slave dances to show her submission and joy of being a slave The chain wraps around her and she writhes and fights at first and fights wildly but she eventually she submits because of her desire and the fire within her belly In the end she shows her joy at feeling the confinement of the chain around her slaveheart Nomads of Gor p Dance of the Thongs The girl has leather thongs attached to her body ankles wrists belly and neck She dances as a girl who is captured She will show her defiance and bewilderment at not being able to move freely the dance growing more frenzied until she is subdued by the Masters that hold her The girl is then presented to one Master who asks her if she is slave to which she will proudly say that she is Raiders of Gor p Love Dance of a Newly Collared Slave The Love Dance of the Newly Collared Slave Girl has many variations in the different citied of Gor but the common theme is that the girl dances her joy that she will soon lie in the arms of a strong master Raiders of Gor Book p Need Dance There are usually five phases to such a dance In the first phase the girl dancing feigns indifference to the presence of men before whom as a slave she must perform In the second phase for she has not yet been raped her distress and uneasiness her restlessness her disturbance by her sexual urges must become subtly more manifest Here it must be evident that she is beginning to feel her sexuality and drives profoundly and yet is struggling against them Toward the end of this phase it must beome clear not only that she has sexual needs and deep ones but that she is beginning to fear that she may not be simply as she is of sufficient interest to men to obtain their satisfaction Here need coupled with anxiety and self doubt for she has not yet been seized by strong men must become clear In the third phase of the dance she in an almost ladylike fashion acknowledges herself defeated in her attempt to conceal her sexuality she then again in an almost ladylike fashion delicately but clearly with restraint but unmistakably acknowledges and publicly before masters that she has sexual needs Then with smiles and gestures displaying herself she makes manifest her readiness for the service of men her willingness and her receptivity She invited them so to speak to have her But she has not yet been seized by an arm or an ankle or by her collar a thumb hooked rudely under it or hair and pulled from the floor What if she is not sufficiently pleasing What if she is not to be fulfilled What if she must continue to dance alone unnoticed At this point it becomes clear to her that it is by no means a foregone conclusion that men will find her of interest or that they will see fit to satisy her She must strive to be pleasing If she is not good enough she may be chained unfilfilled another night alone in the kennel There are always other girls She must earn her rape Too if she should be insufficiently pleasing consistently it is likely that she will be slain goreans place few impediments in the way of liberation of a slave female s sexuality In this fourth phase of the dance then shamelessly the woman dances her need and shamelessly begs for her sexual satisfaction The phase of the dance is sometimes known as the Heat of the Collared She Sleen The fifth and final phase of the dance is far more dramatic and exciting In this phase the girl overcome by sexual desire and terrified that she may not be found sufficiently pleasing clearly manifests and utterly that she is a slave female In this portion of the dance the girl is seldom on her feet Rather sitting rolling and changing position on her side her back her belly half kneeling half sitting kneeling crawling reaching out bending backwards lying down twisting with passion gesturing to her body presenting it to masters for their inspection and interest whimpering moaning crying out brazenly presenting herself as a slave pleading for her rape she writhes a piteous begging vulnerable ready slave a woman fit for and begging for the touch of a master a woman begging to become at the least touch of her master a totally submitted slave The fourth phase of the dance as I have mentioned is sometimes known as the Heat of the Collared She Sleen This portion of the dance the fifth portion is sometimes known as the Heat of the Slave Girl Rogue of Gor p Placatory Dance There are many forms of placatory dances which are performed by female slaves Some of these tend to have rather fixed forms sanctioned by custom and tradition such as the stately Contrition Dance of Turia Some sort of placatory dance is usually taught to the girl in slave training Most placatory dances however are not fixed form dances but are free dances in which the slave exquisitely alert to the nuances of the situation the particular master the nature of his displeasure the gravity of her offense and such improvises to reassure him of the authenticity of her contrition and the genuineness of her desire to do better Dancer of Gor p Pole Dance The slave will attempt to arouse and entice the pole or Master with erotic movements that involve her touching and caressing Him the pole beckoning her use by Him This dance can be done either by securing her to the pole or she may remain free from the pole swirling around in frantic and heated movements Blood Brothers of Gor p Sa eela The Sa eela is one of the most moving deeply rhythmic and erotic of the slaves dances of Gor It belongs generally to the genre of dances commonly known as the Lure Dances of the Love Starved Slave Girl The common theme of the genre of course is the attempt on the part of a neglected slave to call herself to the attention of the master The Sa eela usually performed in the nude as though by a low slave and by a girl freed of all impediments except her collar is one of the most powerful of slave dances of Gor It is done rather differently in different cities but the variations practiced in the river towns and generally in the Vosk basin are in my opinion among the finest Guardsman of Gor p Seduction Dance The name of the dance is fairly self explanitory in this dance the slave tries to seduce a Master perhpas even to get him to buy her Tribesmen of Gor p Serving Scarf or Veil Dance Performed using ribbons or scarves as a form of enticement for the Master The girl will offer to serve the Master in a most exciting manner She typically wears a costume of scarves or uses a ribbon to arouse both herself and the Master Falling to her knees she may offer a lustful serve of ka la na Tribesman of Gor p Stalking Dance of the Panther girls The girls then following her began to dance How starved must be the lonely hating panther women of the forests so gross is their hostility so fierce their hatred and yet need of men They twisted screaming now clawing at the moons I would scarcely have guessed at the primitive hungers evident in each movement of those barbaric feline bodies They would be masters of men Proud magnificent creatures And yet by biology by their beauty by their aroused inwardness could not in fact own but only in their true fulfillment belong be taken be conquered The drum was now very heady swift The dance of the panther girls became more wild more frenzied Vicious sinuous clawing lithe these savage beauties in their skins and gold with their knives their light spears weapons darting danced They were terrible and beautiful in the streaming flooding light of the looming primitive moons of perilous Gor I could hear their cries of rage and need hear their heels striking in the earth their hands slapping at their thighs I saw the teeth of some white bared at the moons their eyes blazing The hair of all was unbound Several had already oblivious of the presence of the men of Tyros torn away their skins to the waist others completely On some I could hear the movement of the necklaces of sleen teeth tied about their necks the shivering and ringing of slender golden bangles on their tanned ankles In their dance they danced among the staked out bodies of the men of Marlenus and about the great Ubar himself Their weapons leapt at the bound men but never did the blows fall The dance would soon strike its climax It could continue little longer The women would go mad with their need to strike and rape Hunters of Gor p Submission Dance Performed for the girl s true Master each dance is different and unique as is each Freeperson It can be done in many ways from the kajira allowing her hands to roam her own body in throbbing lust for her Master to the girl writhing in desire and submitting at His feet Dancer of Gor p Tether Dance I jerked the tether at her throat This is a tether Isaid It is to be well incorporated in your dance You are a tethered slave Do not forget it You may fight the tether you may love it It may confine your body you may use it to caress your body an invitation to your master a surrogate symbol of his domination of you You need not dance always on your feet A woman can dance beautifully on her knees moving as little as a hand or on her back or belly or side In all things do not forget you are a slave Explorers of Gor p Tile Dance The tile dance is commonly performed on red tiles usually beneath the slave ring of the master s couch The girl performs the dance on her back her stomach and sides Usually her neck is chained to the slave ring The dance signifies the restlessness the misery of a love starved slave girl It is a premise of the dance that the girl moves and twists and squirms in her need as if she is completely alone as if her need is known only to herself then supposedly the master surprises her and she attempts to suppress the helplessness and torment of her needs then failing this surrendering her pride in its final shred she writhes openly piteously before him begging him to deign to touch her Needless to say the entire dance is observed by the master and this in fact of course is known to both the dancer and her audience the master The tile dance for simple psychological and behavioral reasons having to do with the submission context and the motions of the body can piteously arouse even a captured cold free woman in the case of a slave of course it can make her scream and sob with need Explorers of Gor p Tuchuk slave love dance The rather savage and wild dance of the slaves of the Wagon People done with much savagery and seduction Nomads of Gor Book p Whip Dance In the whip dance though there are various versions of it depending on the locality the girl is almost never struck with the whip unless of course she does not perform well When the whip is cracked however the girl will commonly react as though she has been struck this conjoined with the music and her beauty and the obvious symbolism of her beauty beneath total male descipline can be extremely powerfully erotic In an elegant civilized context one of beauty and music it makes clear and bespeaks the raw and essential primitives of the ancient genetic biological sexual realtionship of men and women Rogue of Gor p

2246,2246,"Thank you for creating this discussion! I am trying to fix my current year-long (forehead, temples, cheeks). I think it was my high foaming cleanser and high alcohol moisturizing emulsion, so I am currently going on 7-8 months trying out different products to see what works. So far layering has been the biggest help and leads to the least amount of breakouts when switching/trying new products and routines. Hada Labo premium moist is a big one because of the 3% urea content i think. With this product added, I dont feel the tightness AS MUCH throughout the day when I make weird faces to test the elasticity/dehydration of my skin (stretching my mouth open like yawning, lifting my 'all been there too OK haha). I did go to the Derm just to have her check out my dehydration & small reoccurring breakouts and she didnt really help much other than tell me my skin may be a combination of seb derm, rosacea and acne since my skin didnt present obvious signs of either. Right now though, I am still very much dehydrated in the sense that my skin feels tight throughout the day. I do not have much flaking if any and my skin does not look dull or dry (it looks slightly oily and firm).

3268,3268,Najla O Zarmouh DOI 6 s12906 y Background Monoamine oxidase B MAO B inhibitors are widely used in the treatment of Parkinson s disease They increase vital monoamine neurotransmitters in the brain However there is a need for safer natural reversible MAO inhibitors with MAO B selectivity Our previous studies showed that Psoralea corylifolia seeds PCS extract contains compounds that inhibit monoamine oxidase B Methods In this study six of PCS constituents sharing a benzopyrone structure were investigated The compounds Biochanin A BIO A isopsoralen prenylnaringenin neobavaisoflavone psoralen and psoralidin were tested for their ability to inhibit recombinant human MAO A and B hMAO A and hMAO B isozymes The ability of these compounds to inhibit MAO A and MAO B were compared to that of PCS ethanolic extract PCSEE using spectrophotometric assays and confirmed by luminescence assays The highly potent and selective MAO B inhibitor BIO A was further investigated for both isozymes reversibility and enzyme kinetics Molecular docking studies were used to predict the bioactive conformation and molecular interactions of BIO A with both isozymes Results The data obtained indicate that benzopyrones inhibited hMAO A and hMAO B with different degrees as confirmed with the luminescence assay BIO A inhibited hMAO B with high potency and selectivity in the present study IC50 = Œºg mL and showing fold more selectivity than PCSEE hMAO B IC50 = Œºg mL fold selectivity without affecting hydrogen peroxide Furthermore BIO A reversibly and competitively inhibited both hMAOs with significantly lower inhibitory constant Ki in hMAO B nM than hMAO A nM Our docking studies indicated that the H bonds and hydrophobic interactions at the human MAO A and MAO B active sites contributed to the reversibility and selectivity of BIO A Conclusions The data obtained indicate that BIO A is a potent reversible and selective MAO B inhibitor and may be recommended for further investigation in its possible use in the therapeutic management of Parkinson s and Alzheimer s diseases KeywordsHuman monoamine oxidase AHuman monoamine oxidase BBenzopyronePsoralea corylifolia ethanolic extractFlavonoidsCoumarinsBiochanin AReversible competitive inhibitionDocking studies Background Human monoamine oxidases A and B isozymes MAO A and MAO B regulate neurotransmitters such as dopamine DA norepinephrine NE and serotonin HT These metabolizing isozymes belong to the family of flavin containing amine oxidoreductases and are in the mitochondrial membranes of brain neurons and glia in addition to other peripheral cells In neurological disorders with depleting neurotransmitters selective and non selective MAO inhibitors MAOIs are used The specific MAO BIs are well established therapeutics for Parkinson s disease PD and currently paving new avenues for Alzheimer disease AD patients Meanwhile the non selective and selective inhibitors of MAO A MAO AIs are used primarily for patients who have not responded to other antidepressants therapy Some of these therapeutic agents such as moclobemide and pirlindole are currently in use MAOIs can exert multiple pharmacological actions by reducing the enzymatically formed hydrogen peroxide H2O2 and aldehydes cytotoxic byproducts antiapoptotic effects and increasing DA which indirectly attenuates nitric oxide These pharmacological properties of MAOIs can provide neuroprotection against oxidative stress and cell death making them effective against neurodegeneration However the inevitable rare incidences of the MAOIs side effects reaction are causing concerns Nonetheless the newly emerged class of reversible inhibitors of MAO A RIMA clinically showed almost no cheese effect or need for diet restrictions Thus it is important to find reversible inhibitors for effective and safer use emphasized investigations for a new level for MAOs inhibition and MAO inhibitors It is of interest to note that some synthesized coumarin derivatives have potent MAO inhibitions In addition natural coumarins and flavonoids were found to be beneficial for neurological disorders with potent effects on the synthesis of catecholamines and oxidative stress Such shared general benzopyrone structure between flavonoids and coumarins emphasize a high potential to inhibit MAO B Notably Psoralea corylifolia L seeds PCS Plant common name bakuchi family Leguminosae contain a variety of benzopyrone structures as in coumarins and flavonoids derivatives with chromone core structures We previously reported that PCS ranked one of the most potent plant extracts to inhibit recombinant human h MAO B activity among screened extracts Further we have shown the significant selectivity of these compounds to MAO B as compared to MAO A Furthermore the unique constituent of PCS i e bavachinin showed a reversible hMAO inhibition with an hMAO B relative selectivity RSB In a previously reported phytochemical screening the plant seeds were suggested to be a good source for phytomedicines Indeed PCS is one of the most popular traditional medicines officially listed in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia and has a variety of unique beneficial phytochemical constituents The PCS seeds have been recently shown to have chemoprotective and antioxidant properties Some of its investigated phytochemicals showed phytoestrogenic anti inflammatory and neuroprotective properties Moreover the seed s aqueous extract was found to inhibit DA and NE transporters Such properties point the need to investigate benzopyrone moiety of the seeds for their MAO inhibitory effects In the current investigation we selected six commonly known coumarins and flavonoids that share the benzopyrone structure Fig The selected coumarins included psoralen PS isopsoralen IPS and psoralidin PSD The selected flavonoids studied include prenylnaringenin PN neobavaisoflavone NBI and biochanin A BIO A These benzopyrones are reported to be in PCS However the hMAO A and hMAO B inhibitory effects and selectivities of these compounds remain to be elucidated The need to find natural selective and reversible hMAO B inhibitors motivated us to evaluate inhibitory activity and selectivity of six of PCS constituents with benzopyrone structures on human MAO A and MAO B Fig The structures of six Psoralea corylifolia seeds PCS benzopyrone constituents Coumarins include psoralen PS isopsoralen IPS and psoralidin PSD Flavonoids of chromone structure include prenylnaringenin PN neobavaisoflavone NBI and biochanin A BIO A Methods Reagents The tested pure PCS constituents ‚â• of PS and PSD and the standard selective MAO AI clorgyline CLORG were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc Dallas TX USA Hank s Balanced Salt Solution HBSS HEPES benzylamine HCl IPS PN NBI BIO A the selective MAO BI standard selegiline Deprenyl¬Æ DEP and other chemicals and chromatography supplies were purchased from Sigma Aldrich St Louis MO USA Human MAO A and MAO B derived from a recombinant baculovirus infected insect cells and measured in active units U were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and received in a buffer solution at pH The China originated PCS were obtained from East Earth Trade Winds Redding CA USA and the MAO Glo‚Ñ¢ kits from Promega Madison WI USA PCS extraction The dry PCS were milled and sieved into g of fine seed powder and stored in a nitrogen sealed container at ¬∞C To prepare PCSEE we followed the procedure mentioned in our previous study Briefly the fine PCS powder was macerated for two days using ethanol The extract was filtered and the powder obtained was subject to h Soxhlet reflux extraction at ¬∞ to ¬∞C with continuous solvent ethanol renewal every h The combined ethanol extracts were evaporated in a dark hood to obtain an oily non homogenous PCSEE All the collected dry crude extracts and prepared PCS ethanolic stock solutions were stored in glass containers at ¬∞C until use hMAO A and hMAO B enzymatic activity assays A slightly modified continuous spectrophotometric assay for measuring enzymatic H2O2 production was validated before the experiments In this assay the peroxidase chromogen reagent of mM of vanillic acid and ŒºM aminoantipyrine and U purpurogallin mL of horseradish peroxidase HRP type II in HBSS pH was prepared and validated with H2O2 standard curve The linearity of

were optimized to be and mM tyramine HCl and benzylamine HCl for hMAO A and hMAO B reactions The assay was run with and without different standard MAOIs with different selectivities DEP CLORG pirlindole and rasagiline and monitored for few hours Isozymes were found stable within the time of incubation Stock solvents ethanol or dimethyl sulfoxide were kept ‚â§ the final volume of all assays IC50s were measured at earliest readings with high signal to noise ratios possible were H2O2 formed < for hMAO A and hMAO B For the confirmatory luminescence assay using MAO Glo‚Ñ¢ kit the protocol was followed to determining the time of incubation at min at RT guided by Valley s method and the preliminary experiments which we conducted hMAO A and hMAO B spectrophotometric assays The six

the Bio Tek ŒºQuant Monochromatic Microplate Spectrophotometer for time zero H2O2 production progression for each enzyme was measured every min for the duration of the assay First read measurements and the blanks background were subtracted from all absorbance values hMAO A and hMAO B luminescence assay The six benzopyrones PCSEE and DEP inhibitory activities of hMAO A and hMAO B isozymes were confirmed using MAO Glo‚Ñ¢ kit luminescence assay Briefly in white opaque well microplates ŒºL of √ó Œºg mL final concentrations of each test compound standard DEP or PCSEE in reaction buffer of pH

H2O2 scavenging activity assay The H2O2 scavenging activity of PCSEE and BIO A at their highest used MAO inhibitory concentrations was investigated and compared to the standard scavenger L ascorbic acid In well plates ŒºL of √ó final concentration of PCSEE and Œºg mL BIO A and Œºg mL and ascorbic acid and Œºg mL in HBSS were prepared A volume of ŒºL of √ó final concentration of ŒºM H2O2 in HBSS was plated in test wells n = Buffer substituted the H2O2 n = to make blank wells Immediately peroxidase chromogen containing vanillic acid aminoantipyrine and HRP type II were prepared as in the MAO spectrophotometric assay and added as ŒºL per well The developing color at nm was optimally read within min at RT using Bio Tek Synergy HTX Multi Reader absorbance Fluorescent thin layer chromatography analysis PCSEE and BIO A were concurrently run on a silica gel matrix √ó cm2 containing a fluorescent indicator with nm excitation on aluminum foil Sigma Aldrich for thin layer chromatography TLC identification On replicate TLC matrices ŒºL of a cm short band of mg mL PCSEE and and mM BIO A Sigma Aldrich ethanol stock solution were directly deposited at cm or more from TLC

and long nm UV lights Retention factor Rf of BIO A band and a matching band were quantified hMAO A and hMAO B recovery hMAO A and hMAO B were tested for their activity recovery after preincubation with BIO A utilizing a slightly modified method reported by Legoabe et al and using the continuous spectrophotometric assay Briefly in HBSS medium pH BIO A of √ó and √ó IC50 and DEP at √ó IC50 were preincubated separately with U mL hMAO isozymes for min at RT BIO A of √ó IC50 was concurrently preincubated with U mL Buffers substituted inhibitors and isozymes for negative controls and blanks

mix a ŒºL buffer and the original ŒºL previously used a mixture in a well plate By reaching √ó and √ó IC50 BIO A final concentration developing color was immediately monitored using Bio Tek ŒºQuant Spectrophotometer readings at RT Michaelis Menten kinetics The effects of BIO A on Michaelis Menten kinetics parameters of hMAO A and hMAO B were investigated using the same spectrophotometric assay mentioned above Standard DEP was concurrently tested to validate the method Determined DEP kinetics for hMAO A and hMAO B in the conditions of this experiment were determined and used as a standard for the Prism program validation for Inhibitor constant Ki determination of BIO A Briefly seven serially diluted tyramine and benzylamine concentrations were prepared in a range between to mM for hMAO

HBSS pH7 4 substituted inhibitors and isozymes in the negative controls and the blanks respectively After min ŒºL of the enzyme BIO A mixture were added to ŒºL of the related substrate chromogen reagent mix in well plates Developing color was monitored at RT using Bio Tek ŒºQuant Spectrophotometer Values of maximum velocity Vmax Michaelis constant Km and consequently Ki were determined Molecular docking studies To understand the possible molecular interactions between BIO A and isozymes active sites we used the HYBRID docking method of OEDocking v 1 OpenEye Scientific Software Inc Santa Fe NM USA Both X ray crystal structures of human h MAO A in complex with harmine PDB ID Z5X and human h MAO B in complex with benzofuranyl imidazoline BFI PDB ID XFN were downloaded from the RCSB Protein Data Bank PDB Both proteins structures were imported into Sybyl X environment of Tripos International St Louis MO where the protein s chain A were extracted and refined using the Biopolymer Structure Preparation Tool Atom types were corrected amino acid residues were repaired active water molecules were retained and all hydrogen atoms were added to both proteins The cofactor flavin adenine dinucleotide FAD and its covalent linkage to the cysteine residues of hMAO A CYS A and hMAO B CYS A were retained during the docking process To be ready for the docking the energy of each protein was minimized using the MMFF94 charges with the MMFF94s force fields For docking the compound of interest BIO A the low energy D conformers were generated using OMEGA version 6 of the same software The bound standard ligands of Z5X and XFN were sketched using Sybyl sketch and were re docked to the crystal structures of the proteins for method validation The root mean square deviation values between retrieved and re docked poses of the ligands were less than √Ö Top ten poses were examined BIO A was then docked as a test ligand to both MAO proteins at their Ligand Binding Domain The H bonds formed between BIO A and amino acid residues of the top poses were measured Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism program version for Windows GraphPad Prism Software Inc San Diego CA USA Data points and parameters were expressed as the mean ¬± SEM of all data All parameters were calculated from non linear regressions with the best R2 values

s multiple comparisons test Results PCS benzopyrones Inhibition of hMAO A and hMAO B To investigate the hMAO A and hMAO B inhibitory effects of the six PCS benzopyrones constituents we determined their enzymatic H2O2 IC50s using a spectrophotometric assay Fig Table and verified their inhibition by a luminescence assay Fig a and b In both assays solvents used in compounds stocks showed no significant difference from the controls without solvents From the first glance at the Table of Fig benzopyrones of flavonoids and coumarins results clearly indicate an array of hMAO A and hMAO B inhibition potencies with hMAO A and hMAO B IC50s less than ~ and ~ ŒºM respectively Compared with standards CLORG and DEP hMAO A IC50s of the benzopyrones showed BIO A > IPS > PN > NBI > PS > PSD no detectable inhibition with IPS PS and NBI having a relative selectivity to inhibit hMAO A RSA Meanwhile hMAO B IC50s showed BIO A > PN > IPS > NBI > PS > PSD partial inhibition p < with BIO A and PN having a relative selectivity in favor to inhibit hMAO B RSB In this assay BIO A was by far the most potent and selective hMAO B inhibitor among the six tested benzopyrones Fig Inhibition potencies

experiments of n = RSA and RSB are the ratio between high isozyme IC50 to the low IC50 Significances of differences between groups and control were determined using a one way ANOVA followed by Dunnett s multiple comparisons test p ‚â§ p < All the six benzopyrones activities against hMAO A and hMAO B were further confirmed at a fixed concentration using MAO Glo‚Ñ¢ kit luminescence assay a highly sensitive and an H2O2 independent technique Fig a and b Standard DEP and PCSEE were used as positive controls All benzopyrones at Œºg mL are differently affected hMAO B hMAO A p ‚â§ to confirming the inhibitory array pattern of the spectrophotometric assay with even higher inhibitory effects Consistent with our spectrophotometric assay selectivity data IPS PS and NBI were more effective against hMAO A and PN was more effective against hMAO B while BIO A selectivity was masked by its highly potent effects using luminescence Thus the relative selectivity of benzopyrones matching the spectrophotometric assay is an indication that these benzopyrones possess hMAO A and hMAO B inhibitory effects with different selectivities BIO A and PCSEE Inhibition of hMAO A and hMAO B To compare the BIO A inhibitory potencies of hMAO A and hMAO B with PCSEE inhibitory potencies we elucidated PCSEE effects on both isozymes H2O2 production using the same spectrophotometric assay Fig Ethanol

Œºg mL hMAO A Nevertheless the left shifted BIO A curves compared to PCSEE curves display BIO A significantly higher potency and RSB than PCSEE Fig b Fig BIO A and PCSEE selectively inhibited H2O2 produced by hMAO B more than hMAO A using a spectrophotometric assay without scavenging H2O2 a PCSEE inhibited both isozymes from producing H2O2 and inhibits hMAO B selectively b BIO A inhibited hMAO

way ANOVA followed by Dunnett s multiple comparisons test p ‚â§ p < BIO A and PCSEE H2O2 scavenging activity H2O2 scavenging activities were tested to reveal BIO A and PCSEE direct effects on the enzymatic H2O2 or other side interactions with the hMAOs assays Fig c The ascorbic acid standard showed a complete scavenging activity at all tested concentrations p < However the high tested concentrations of BIO A and PCSEE did not show any scavenging activities Moreover PCSEE increased the H2O2 signal p ‚â§ which may indicate other autoxidation reactions that occur only at a very high concentration of Œºg mL The results suggest that the inhibition of enzymatic H2O2 by BIO A and PCSEE were solely by the mechanism of inhibiting hMAO A and hMAO B and not by H2O2 scavenging activities Identification of BIO A in PCSEE BIO A identification was verified in the PCSEE extract using the fluorescent silica gel TLC and our optimized developing system Fig d BIO A s non fluorescent dark band on the TLC plate matched a non fluorescent dark band in PCSEE fingerprint at both UV excitation waves At nm BIO A band Rf = ¬± was visibly matching one of the PCSEE dark bands Rf = ¬± at similar conditions p > At nm with BIO A increased concentration BIO A dark band matched a non fluorescent dark band in the PCSEE fingerprint developed bands Thus in addition to its identification of the used

between two groups using unpaired t test ns non significant p ‚â§ p < p < hMAO A and hMAO B reversibility of inhibition by BIO A To determine if BIO A is a reversible hMAO A and hMAO B inhibitor we tested the recovery of both isozymes from BIO A inhibition after dilution Fig a and b with time monitoring Fig c and d Compared to controls the √ó IC50 of standard DEP reduced both isozymes activities to with hMAO A and with hMAO B instead of respectively That is an indication of possible slow partial or no recovery of the isozymes from DEP inhibition at the experimental conditions With hMAO B repeatedly unexpected observed high signal with DEP could be due to interactions with hMAO B sample contaminants at very elevated levels of drug and enzyme Conversely in similar preincubation conditions of BIO A with hMAO A and hMAO B dilution allowed a complete or an almost complete recovery of activities The hMAO A Fig a and hMAO B Fig b catalytic rates with and √ó IC50 BIO A were ~ and ~ respectively Both isozymes constant recovery with time Fig c and d is a character of a reversible inhibitor as the activities of recovered enzymes were similar to the enzymes subjected directly to or √ó IC50 of BIO A The obtained results demonstrate evidence that BIO A is a reversible inhibitor of hMAO A and hMAO B BIO A induced changes of hMAO A and hMAO B Michaelis Menten parameters To determine the mode of BIO A reversible inhibition on both MAOs we investigated BIO A effects on Michaelis Menten kinetics of hMAO A and hMAO B at their initial velocities Fig In Fig a and b Lineweaver Burk plot linear regressions for the BIO A increased IC50 fold co intersected at the Y axis indicating a competitive mode of inhibition in both isozymes Compared to control in Table of Fig c BIO A showed no significant change in hMAO A Vmax while Km values significantly p < geometrically doubled fold respectively with increasing BIO A IC50s fold of concentrations Similarly hMAO B Vmax showed no significant changes while benzylamine Km values were significantly p < nearly linearly increased fold respectively with the BIO A doubled IC50s The obtained data indicate the competitiveness of BIO A to inhibit both isozymes BIO A Ki and SI determination To confirm competitiveness of BIO A for hMAO A and hMAO B inhibitions and consequently determine BIO A Ki and its hMAO B selectivity index SI we analyzed Michaelis Menten data by best fit enzyme inhibitory models using GraphPad Prism Fig d Table The mixed enzyme inhibition model for standard DEP indicated a competitive inhibitory mode for hMAO A alpha > and a non competitive mode for hMAO B inhibition alpha ~ Meanwhile the same model supported that BIO A impedes substrate binding affinity to both isozymes alpha > > Thus the analysis confirms BIO competitiveness for both isozymes and rejects the non competitive uncompetitive behavior Consequently BIO A Ki values showed that BIO A SI has a tight affinity to bind to hMAO B more than hMAO A fold p < Molecular docking of BIO A To recognize the molecular level of the interactions of BIO A with the amino acids in the active site involved in its MAOs reversible and competitive inhibitions we conducted a molecular docking study on both isozymes Fig BIO A was well docked to the same human MAO A and hMAO B crystal structure active sites at which Z5X and XFN interacted respectively Fig In the MAO A compact active site cavity BIO A matched the Z5X pose with its C3 phenyl ring and the chromone core structure embedded in the hydrophobic zone of the entrance site Fig a Brown zone Also BIO A was predicted to be a donor for a relatively tight H bond √Ö formed between the hydrogen of its C7 OH group and the nitrogen FAD of the enzyme Fig c Table Therefore the reversible H bond with FAD and the hydrophobic interactions at the entrance cavity may contribute to BIO A reversible competitive behavior in effectively inhibiting human MAO A Fig BIO A docking orientations within human MAO A and MAO B crystal structure active sites BIO A is a gray molecule active sites the neutral zones are gray the lipophilic zones are brown and the hydrophilic zones are blue in color a within MAO A with Z5X ligand standard in green and b within MAO B with XFN ligand standard in green In table c predicted BIO A H bonds numbers distances √Ö type of H bonds between BIO A on left and residue on right b and involved amino acid residues are compared to the two standard ligands docked within the same site a Key LEU leucine PRO proline TYR tyrosine at the A chain of MAO B Nonetheless BIO A showed stronger interactions at the active site of MAO B than MAO A All of the BIO A i e the lipophilic chromone core structure the C3 phenyl ring and possibly the methyl group of C4 positions were completely embedded in the MAO B active site lipophilic zones away from the FAD Fig b Brown zone Notably BIO A was predicted to be a donor and an acceptor for two distant H bond One at the entrance cavity between the oxygen acceptor of its C4 OCH3 group and the active water molecule and the other is closer to the substrate cavity between the carbon donor of its C7 OH and the Leucine Fig c Table The BIO A H bond distances were close to the XFN H bond distances The predicted reversible hydrophobic interactions and distant H bonds formations might consistently reflect the high affinity reversibility and competitiveness extent of BIO A towards its MAO B mode of inhibition Discussion As part of our search for safe natural MAO B inhibitors and guided by selecting benzopyrone structures we focused our efforts to investigate compounds that could be responsible for the plant PCS selective MAO B inhibition Furthermore we characterized the action of the most potent and selective inhibitor In the current investigation we tested PCS as well as six of its benzopyrone constituents for their hMAO A and hMAO B inhibitions The PCS isoflavone constituent BIO A was found to be the most potent and selective hMAO B inhibitor in this study BIO A was also more potent and selective than PCSEE The presence of BIO A in PCSEE was verified and their inhibition of MAOs did not involve H2O2 scavenging activity Furthermore our results indicated that BIO A is a reversible and competitive hMAOI with an SI to inhibit hMAO B In molecular docking experiments BIO A selective activity was accompanied with two reversible H bonds and three hydrophobic interactions with the human MAO B active site which were more than the reversible interactions formed with the MAO A active site The results obtained showed that BIO A dihydroxy methoxyisoflavone is the most potent hMAO A and hMAO B inhibitor with the highest MAO B selectivity out of the tested benzopyrones and PCSEE Figs and The obtained PCSEE results are consistent with our previous reports on the potency and selectivity using spectrophotometric and fluorescence assays with different extraction methods We verified the presence of BIO A in our used PCSEE to confirm previously reported ¬± w w of BIO A in the dried PCS BIO A IC50 and RS results on both isozymes were consistent with the more reflective parameter of its binding affinity Ki that was higher in hMAO B than hMAO A Fig Notably BIO A at a very high concentration becomes less selective due to the structure similarities of both isozymes Figs and Similarly standards pirlindole DEP and RAS become non selective when their concentrations are highly increased The obtained results indicate the non selectivity of the studied coumarins as MAOIs These results are supported by previous reports which indicate PCS total furocoumarins had antidepressant effects in mice and showed in vitro rat MAOs inhibitory effects and another study reported PS and IPS inhibitory effects of rat MAOs Additionally we used luminescence assay for confirmation of spectrophotometric assay isozymes effective inhibitions the luminescence assay is independent of measuring H2O2 with a lower representation of the biological reactions The varied inhibitory potencies may differ with the enzyme source and methods used as it was previously reported with other MAO BIs BIO A structure and the tested benzopyrones are absent of any reactive terminal amino groups as in DEP or phenelzine that can covalently bind at the MAO active site Our docking evaluation indicated that the non covalent molecular interactions were underlying BIO A competitiveness for hMAO A and hMAO B Fig and thus supported our biochemical data In the human MAO B BIO A contained two H bonds comprising the acceptor and the donor of the C7 OH and the C4 OCH3 groups respectively Fig Previous docking studies indicated that flavonoids H bond donors or acceptors complemented with lipophilic interactions are candidates to modulate both rat MAOs activities Additionally two predicted H bonds at hMAO B in our previous reports of flavonoids bavachinin and genistein were accompanied with competitive hMAO B inhibitory effects with higher hMAO B affinity than MAO A Thus the two H bond acceptors with the three hydrophobic groups in BIO A held the best features of the MAO BI flavonoid pharmacophore more than MAO A These consistent results point out H bonds as a possible critical factor for the human MAO B affinity stabilization and consequently a better flavonoid inhibitory activity In MAO A however the prediction of a single but crucial H bond with FAD may explain BIO A lower affinity potency and higher competitiveness to inhibit MAO A than B In addition to our results in hMAO A and hMAO B inhibitions BIO A was reported to have several multiple pharmacological functions BIO A was reported to be neuroprotective in in vitro and in vivo studies through its multimechanistic antiinflammatory antioxidant and phytoestrogenic properties BIO A inhibited lipopolysaccharide LPS induced dopaminergic cell damage in rats and LPS induced activation of microglia protected from the glutamate and AŒ≤ induced cytotoxicity in neuropathological rat models and the glutamate induced cytotoxicity in human cortical neurons More importantly BIO A ameliorated age and drug induced cognitive and behavioral dysfunctions in mice model improved the neuronal viability vascular functions and memory and promoted the recovery of peripheral nerve injuries in rat models It also reduced acetylcholinesterase in dementia mouse and rat models Such reports indicate that BIO A can provide neuroprotective effects in different animal models and provide evidence that BIO A can cross the blood brain barrier From another perspective BIO A was reported of being metabolized by O demethylation by P450 isoforms mainly CYP1A2 to genistein Moreover genistein was also reported to be metabolized back to BIO A by O methylation by rat liver enzymes Furthermore in our recent investigations genistein was found to be an active MAOI BIO A with its metabolite genistein shared hepatoprotective antimicrobial and anticancer activities Having BIO A and genistein to be human MAOIs the two analogs mutual presence is highly possible in the blood and hence their possible activity in the brain against neurodegeneration The present kinetics studies indicate that BIO A can be a safe and effective MAO BI The relatively superior selectivity of BIO A can eliminate oxidative stress produced by both H2O2 and toxic aldehydes which are generated by hMAO B The reversibility and competitiveness of BIO A for hMAOs inhibitions can also eliminate the classical side effects related to MAOIs irreversibilities such as the cheese effect psychosis withdrawal and possible drug interactions Consequently BIO A may safely reduce the aging brain oxidative stress by introducing a new mechanism for reversibly inhibiting both human MAOs with MAO B inhibitory selectivity There are other natural products with MAO B inhibition proposed for neuroprotection and there is a need to disclose their value in PD and AD patients Conclusions It was concluded from the current study that BIO A as a PCS benzopyrone constituent was found to be the most potent and selective human MAO B inhibitor among the studied benzopyrones BIO A and the variable hMAO A and hMAO B inhibitions of benzopyrones may partially explain the PCSEE MAO B inhibition potency and selectivity The results also indicated that BIO A is a reversible and competitive MAOI with a high selectivity index and high affinity to inhibit MAO B The predicted interactions of BIO A with the active site amino acids involve reversible H bonds and hydrophobic interactions instead of irreversible covalent adducts This combined mechanism of MAO B selectivity and reversibility may provide a greater safety margin and prevent the classical MAOIs side effects and following drug restrictions Supported by previous reports our data highlights BIO A potentials to be used for the management of age related neurodegenerative diseases such as PD and AD Abbreviations

7904,7904,"I've played WoW a lot until 2012 and i've been a DC fan since 2013 and i'm still reading the comics to this day. And i have some questions about this game since it looks very cool and i'm hungry for some DC games: 1- Is this game heavily based on group play? I like grouping though but just not ALL the time since i like being at my own pace at times and not dependant on strangers constantly. So basically i'm asking how the single player content is. 2- How is the gear system? In WoW your character was insanely gear dependant. This bothered me a lot where i can't do a dungeon only because i lacked that one, simple minor wristband that barely made a difference anyway. 3- How are the drop chances in dungeons? WoW just had laughably bad drop chances and doing one dungeon for a chestpiece over 6 times only for someone else to win the item is not my idea of fun. 4- How is the community? Is it active enough? 5- Do quests/side quest begin to feel like a chore where they are all the same thing with a different name? WoW's quests were so long and so dull it felt like homework with barely any worthy reward (vendor gear that sells for 3 silver, whoopie doo!). I felt as if my feet were made of rocks in that game and walking through quicksand only to finally get on dry stable land and getting a slap in the face for it and getting told to do it again with crap rewards. I know i come off pretty strong and probably not MMO material but this game seems like a lot of fun and i'm just wary of MMO's since WoW gave me a bad taste in my mouth the more the game grew."

13000,13000,I started an entry the other night a Memorial Day weekend journal post begins but the phone kept ringing and it got later so I ve scrubbed it all On May I took my late parents to the Sheraton by the airport so the following morning they could board a flight to Florida and inspect work on their retirement home which was completing construction I was escaping St Paul yet again to stay at their temporary condo in Mound not far from where I went to high school on the site of this beautiful page torn from my teenage years Just before they left town we had a family photo taken with us all wearing denim shirts at a Brookdale Proex photo at right with my first nephew Colin in aforementioned denim In another month I d be boarding another plane for my cousin Jason s wedding in south Texas In the interim I was wrapping up a contract project at CTS in Minneapolis and volunteering at Cable Access St Paul where new friend Ben Simon and I did tech work camera sound etc on the program Docksides after which we walked over to Galtier Plaza and talked for over an hour over two beers about stories Life and the rest of the production crew showed up and like Techies assholes snubbed us it bothered Ben more than I Much happened more than I first sensed The journal makes an odd observation To know your personal value is no small thing The waves of influence Personal power Ideas moving people Wow I was years old and writing like a maniac On June I paid for my flight to Jason s wedding in Corpus Christi on June the journal reports No indication how I was feeling about that how expensive it was given I was unemployed for a while but I was looking forward to traveling again and seeing new sights Meanwhile much was going on in the lives of friends and family the biggest seeing my parents off to retirement thousands of miles away in mid June better chronicled in a future post For cousin Jason s wedding it s best to just throw out here mostly unedited and transcribed as it appeared in the journal photo at left which was one of the strangest experiments I ever did in the early s journals I didn t take a laptop to Texas or the actual journal for that matter but instead brought a small Daytimer journal where I painstakingly wrote in mechanical pencil the events of the wedding When I got back to Minnesota I transcribed them into the journal which took up four and half single spaced pages In the interest of keeping this post short I ve edited for clarity where possible Tuesday June Here s the transcript from Corpus Crispy Airlines doctor s offices treat you like you NEED them Oh Babylon Oh Airline Industry Here s my predictions on the wedding party just by studying the invite Alaniz family Maids of honor Jessica Ann Patricia Andrea are sisters of Yvonne s the bride both are obviously unmarried No guess about ages I ll try no much younger Ana Lisa is married I d guess and Luis Daniel Sara Ann are her son and daughter no I don t think so Cynthia Canales don t know I guess she s a friend of Yvonne s unmarried but with a boyfriend There s no other Canales listed so that s why I d guess that dead on Seems the Vasquez Alaniz families are pretty close related Yvonne s two brothers I d guess are the two ushers cousins Billy Joel s Rosalinda s Eyes FLYING OVER CLINTON S CLOUDY AMERICA LBJ shudder See muh scar PM passed over Dallas Fort Worth WHATABURGER w onions jalapenos When I first hear about these I was asking about all the billboards but Gabriel had said Waterburger and I didn t understand Pico de Gallo cilantro onions chilies tomatoes = hot CORPUS DAY TWO Got in last night at AM Slept this morning till wedding s at PM today Jason Yvonne Joe Cynthia got in a tiff Bought Gabriel a Whataburger after midnight between the two of us but that included fries and drinks In my Uncle Gordon s van Lou drove Jason shotgun me Greg the Best Man from Albuquerque NM Freddy quiet guy Gabriel Joe all the rest of us were at least

spoke of Cheers final episode and empty characters It was I thought a pugnacious sermon But from the beginning THE WEDDING got some sun Friday Miscue on the wedding march had to start again I sat w Kelly Bret Marcy Andrew who fussed Virginia sat at the end of our pew to my right We said Peace be with you to each other as everyone else did during the Mass Wedding went from to or so Monsignor Michael Heras was amusing as I said He instructed the congregation not to chew gum during the Mass I suspect not just because they d take the Eucharist Pictures after there was a brief rain shower

Some regrets not near the beach see smell the Gulf of Mexico not getting to see San Antonio the River walk Indefinable not belonging yet honorary belonging will get into this more About Saturday We were late for the gift opening at the Alanizes at getting there closer to PM I d wanted to go to San Antonio or the beach for the day but it was raining all over South Texas It was at the gift opening that I noticed Jessica a year old cousin I assumed of Yvonne s She acted a little older than her age which I learned when mention was made of her Turned years Party like a coming out or confirmation celebration big I gathered in Hispanic culture an event two years in the future She was proud of planning for it already She was wearing a sleeveless blue denim shirt with a black silver crucifix on a chain around her neck and pink denim shorts She s a classic Mexican beauty long clumpy dark brown hair and golden brown eyes that really twinkled tiny pink lips and skin that was perfect She had gangly long arms and legs and really was a child I of course thought of the youthful Ellen Terry in spirit which in a land of symbols can still mean anything She was curled up in a lounger in the living room watching Poltergeist III when I first saw her her twinkling eyes spraying everyone with generosity and cheer I was a little embarrassed I was so struck with her beauty in light of her age I tried to tell myself I was appreciating beauty for its own sake of course The beers sanctioned by Texas State Law Bud Bud Lite Miller Miller Lite Bob Dylan s Just Like Tom Thumb s Blues I started out on burgundy But soon hit the harder stuff Everybody said they d stand behind me when The game got rough But the joke was on me There was nobody even there to bluff I m goin back to St Paul I do believe I ve had enough Ginny didn t have an opinion about Bob Dylan U turn lanes what a concept Texans don t stop they YIELD to oncoming traffic Humidity s always high Everything sweats windows eyeglasses pop cans and the cockroaches I saw one dead in the men s room of the Eagle Lodge one alive on the wall of the motel outside alive and pokey he gingerly scratched his hairy insect ass like it was nobody s business nobody and NOBODY fucks with a South Texas cockroach At the Greyhound race track I was tired but was still glad we got out of the house on a rainy night Joe had the right idea He seemed to warm up to me after Friday night maybe because I stuck around after the Menudo I think Joe s looking forward to when his son Daniel now will be my age so he can take him hunting and to the track Some words then about belonging or my frustration about not belonging I ve got to find HOME That s my career for the rest of my life I ve seen so many alternatives Aunt Joyce said when I was young I was too picky She s dead right But We all go our roads find our paths as we may or as we go I looked back England Minnesota Kentucky Indiana now Texas where next California Mexico Florida Texas accent I actually heard little of it a few old white folks at the wedding reception and dance The drawl it s deceptive Punch and push go go get it Give it gas Use it Plastic pushing nail biting Yeah I ve got to remember I have an artistic mission It s no small thing Remember that Always

13176,13176,"Here is another poem Previous Don't Quit by John Greenleaf Whittier Next When things go wrong as they sometimes will, When the road you're trudging seems all up hill, When the funds are low and the debts are high And you want to smile, but you have to sigh, When care is pressing you down a bit, Rest if you must, but don't you quit. Life is strange with its twists and turns As every one of us sometimes learns And many a failure comes about When he might have won had he stuck it out; Don't give up though the pace seems slow‚Äî You may succeed with another blow. Success is failure turned inside out‚Äî The silver tint of the clouds of doubt, And you never can tell just how close you are, It may be near when it seems so far; So stick to the fight when you're hardest hit‚Äî It's when things seem worst that you must not quit."

1347,1347,So we have general population people who have a few ideas about what should be done Type A wants it all opened up let the dead and weak die and lets get back to work usually because they need to make their next car payment The problem with type A is that they do not realize that even the healthy looking people may drop dead a few months down the line if they get continuous exposure and that this virus is not acting as predictably as a bad flu Type B wants to wait for a vaccine The problem with type B is they have too much faith in science without realizing that science especially vaccine research has limitations and that this virus contains more than one of those limitations Type C is not coughing or thinks they just have allergies and is convinced this is all a hoax because they have not personally seen anyone drop dead yet They want the same thing as type A The problem with type C is the school system They never learned how exponential math works They are just so accustomed to being lied to that they think absolutely everything is a lie Type D looks at every slight lowering of the numbers and thinks this means everything is getting better and can go back to normal They do not realize that people dying per day in a country is not actually much closer to normal than people dying per day or that just a few weeks ago only people were dying per day Type E are my favorite Most people including those above fall under type E Type E do not see the slow demolition of civilization that we are in They think everything is going to keep functioning that supplies are only limited due to sudden demand or dumb bureaucrats and that there is a normal to go back to They genuinely think they see the light at the end of the tunnel and are already making plans when we have barely passed the entrance of a pitch black tunnel with curves Quoting TlvmmCpoft And then there are the GLP folks who have been watching this slow motion trainwreck for three months now just three months It feels like three fucking years and while we have learned a lot about this demon virus we find out every day that we have not even started to scratch the surface of what is happening to our world Quoting John the Baptist And then there s Type GLP Doom sponges conspiring to survive this for the long term and share all info for the sake of awareness and debate with the end goal of uncovering the deep truth Quoting KingSkyWolf Yep GLP is just about the only place I can talk about what s likely to come next with the virus without everyone looking at me like I am insane This is despite my warning some of the non GLPs in my life that quarantine etc were coming them not believing me and then it coming And every other stage But they can never handle the idea of the next stage being possible until it happens It makes me want to pull my hair out It s not like I go around holding a board and saying the end is neigh and this is my normal behavior and I am just crazy The last time I even bothered to prep for something was a month s worth of food for Y2K in case the computers did all need to be rebooted The only crazy thing I have ever shared with the normies you guys see a hell of a lot more from me than they do was my illegal adoption Sans just about every single detail And I have been telling them about it since I was a kid In summary talking to people who can not even see the road in front of them is about to drive me to fucking drink more than usual Last Edited by TlvmmCpoft on PM

7486,7486,"Hello fellow 997 owners. I've owned my Arctic Silver 2006 C2 since late February, 2020. I'm been slowly modding it to be a lightweight fun street car. I've posted some stuffs here and there on the 997 forum and I've been asked a few times about the things I've done to it. So I figured that I might as well start a thread. Mods with weight savings: rear seat, user manual, tools removal - 32.8 lbs gutted trunk and amplifier removal - 14 lbs rear subwoofer removal - 14.4 lbs radio delete - 5.3 lbs passenger mat - 2.5 lbs draining washer fluid (left enough fluid to prevent low fluid warning light) - 6 lbs center console removal - 6 lbs MRG titanium wheel studs kit - 2 lbs Fortune Auto coilovers (weight saving mainly from front struts) - 8 lbs RSS engine mounts - 2 lbs MoMo Mod 07 steering wheel - 3 lbs Antigravity 30Ah lithium battery - 43.6 lbs Recaro Pole Position ABE seats - 51.8 lbs The Rennline 4"" shifter riser and Function First ebrake riser added back 2 lbs. So the total weight removed so far is 189.4 lbs. Forged magnesium wheels from AWC and a complete custom titanium exhaust system is planned for another 100 lbs worth of weight saving. Here's the link to the Google doc spreadsheet that covers all the things I've done to the car with some more details. There's more that I've done to the car than what's listed above.It was more for personal record keeping but I have no issue sharing it. =0 I not only put in the pricing of the items, but also link to the product page and or page number in the workshop manual to perform the job. There's also a weight saving $/lbs column to show how effective the mod is in terms of money spent. And if you have any weight saving ideas that you want to share with people. Feel free to do so in this thread too. I'm always open to ideas. Although the 996 CLR project that I was following pretty much covers all the possible weight saving options without completely gutting the interior of the car. Here are some photos of my car."

3539,3539,"[QUOTE=""dimebag, post: 4759040, member: 62889""] Hi ya, I‚Äôm in the midst of a few lingering maintenance items which includes a coolant change out. I‚Äôve read the post which identifies the H-D coolant as [URL=' '] Peak Global Lifetime 50/50 in the Gold colored bottle[/URL]. I went out and bought a gallon of said Peak coolant as the H-D coolant I had on hand was only about 39oz and not enough for the entire 81oz capacity (2.4L) of the cooling system. The H-D coolant I poured in was neon orange and opaque. After I measured out the remaining 39 oz I had, I cracked open the Peak bottle and poured it into my measuring device. The Peak coolant is visually different appearing as a translucent green, maybe yellow, not the neon orange of the H-D. This leads me to believe there is a different formulation and before I go mixing the two creating an adverse reaction id like some verification or validation. Am I good to mix the two? Did Harley specify a color for whatever reason? I‚Äôve verified the coolant is in-fact Peak Global Lifetime 50/50 in the Gold colored bottle per the original post but again the coolant color vastly different. Thanks, [/QUOTE] I've used Peak Global lifetime for 5 years. It's Pink. Have not bought any in a year but ""translucent green, maybe yellow"" doesn't sound right, I wouldn't mix them. Just my 2cts - I usePeak w/water wetter mixed in in warm months, full strength peak in late fall and winter storage. Flush every 2 years with distilled water.

2744,2744,"When you are sealing your cylinders bases to the case, don't get crazy with the RTV. Adding a ton of extra isn't going to help them seal any more. Prep work and proper machining is what makes them seal up properly. I like to use Permatex Ultra Black because it is very oil resistant. I wipe down all the surfaces with acetone. Then I put a very thin bead on and then use a cut down acid brush to smear it around. I also put a thin smear on each end where the push rod tube seals sit. When it all goes together, hardly anything squeezes out to the outside. This also means hardly anything squeezes to the inside, which is more important. Chunks of RTV inside an engine are a bad deal. I learned the hard way on my '83 CJ-7 when I was 19."

5779,5779,"Fashion Source:PINKVILLA The World is moving and progressing at a lightening speed. Given that we have the Internet at our beck and call, the distance and difference between people, places, trends and communication is continuously blurring. But this wasn't the case about a decade ago. At that time we didn't have the crazy access tot he Internet as we have now. Thus the whole credit of bringing International fashion to India goes to Sonam K Ahuja. The diva single handedly bridged the gap between runway fashion and high street styles. The Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga actress is currently vacationing in Los Angeles along with her baby sister, Rhea Kapoor and husband, Anand Ahuja. Sonam dolled up as she was all set to attend a Lakers game. She donned a high neck polo midnight blue top which she teamed up with a pleated ankle length skirt. She threw on a red Bhane sweater with white prints on it. The interesting was in the styling. Kapoor Ahuja styled her look with silver oxidised necklace and earrings, center parted poker straight hair, filled in brows, deep lips and black boots. The whole look put together gives a very fresh and chic vibe. We love how she has layered her outfit with a sweater without making it seem like she has put in too many efforts. Also, brownie points for styling her look with silver oxidised jewellery! We like. What do you think about Sonam K Ahuja's look? Do you think the silver oxidised jewellery looks nice?

I use it on my chest and shoulders every couple of days as well and found out the other day that it is also excellent to sooth a sunburn! I can't say enough about it!

12963,12963,"Britain has only one F1 race at Silverstone which is on very shaky grounds for the future.Why then are most F1 teams based there.Could it be because most of the teams were essentially kit cars, apart from tube steel chassis, and used British engines such as the Coventy Climax or Cosworth and British gearboxes such as the Hewland.That simply does not happen these days.With Brexit about to happen F1 teams must start to wonder why they remain there if they have to put up with complicated border controls between races and work permits.Racing Point is not British owned but has recently purchased a big block of land adjacent to one of their existing factories that came to them with the Force India assets purchase.They could probably do a really good deal to move to Europe and base themselves somewhere like Paul Ricard in France. They are going to build a new factory anyway and could get a government incentive.Mercedes could relocate to Germany.A Renault move to France would be well received and could get a government subsidy.Red Bull's major shareholder is German and they also have an existing base in Italy with their second team or could move to Germany. There is a Google article that says Red Bull, the drink, is banned in France. If so, they would hardly move there.Red Bull, in any case, for the umteenth time, is again threatening to pull out of F1 anyway, but they could simply close the British Based team and transfer technology to Torro Rosso and concentrate on a single team Maybe a buyer could be found for the British ex-Jaguar team.The thing is that a European base makes more sense when travelling to most rounds and there are plenty of airports for overseas round.My pick would be Switzerland and the better tax situation. karter Team Manager 11354 Postsjoined 21 Sep 04 offline Posted¬†-¬†24 Mar 2019¬†: 14:26:18 F1 teams were based in Britain before the EC existed, and many races are outside Europe anyway, so I doubt if Brexit would be much of a deciding factor."

3885,3885,Background Reducing the disease burden of major depressive disorder MDD is of major public health relevance The prevention of depression is regarded as one possible approach to reach this goal People with multiple risk factors for MDD such as chronic back pain and subthreshold depressive symptoms may benefit most from preventive measures The Internet as intervention setting allows for scaling up preventive interventions on a public mental health level Methods This study is a multicenter pragmatic randomized controlled trial RCT of parallel design aiming to investigate the cost effectiveness of an Internet and mobile based intervention IMI for the prevention of depression in chronic back pain patients PROD BP with subthreshold depressive symptoms eSano BackCare DP is a guided chronic back pain specific depression prevention intervention based on cognitive behavioral therapy CBT principles comprising six weekly plus three optional modules and two booster sessions after completion of the intervention Trained psychologists provide guidance by sending feedback messages after each module A total of patients with chronic back pain and without a depressive disorder at baseline will be recruited following orthopedic rehabilitation care and allocated to either intervention or treatment as usual TAU Primary patient relevant endpoint of the trial is the time to onset of MDD measured by the telephone administered Structured Clinical Interview for DSM SCID at baseline and year post randomization Key secondary outcomes are health related quality of life depression severity pain intensity pain related disability ability to work intervention satisfaction and adherence as well as side effects of the intervention Online assessments take place at baseline and weeks as well as and months post randomization Cox regression survival analysis will be conducted to estimate hazard ratio at month follow up Moreover an economic analysis will be conducted from a societal and public health perspective Discussion This is the first study examining an IMI for depression prevention in a sample of chronic pain patients If this implementation of a depression prevention IMI into orthopedic aftercare proves effective the intervention could be integrated into routine care with minimal costs and extended for use with other chronic diseases Results will have implications for researchers health care providers and public health policy makers Trial registration The trial is registered at the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform via the German Clinical Studies Trial Register DRKS DRKS00007960 Registered August Keywords Background Major depressive disorder MDD is related to high disease burden for both people affected and society In a recent literature review investigating global variation in the prevalence and incidence of MDD a global point prevalence of a lifetime prevalence between and and a global incidence of have been reported It is estimated that existing psychological and pharmacological treatments have the potential to avert only of the burden of MDD and only when assuming perfectly efficient provision of existing treatments in terms of coverage patient compliance an d clinician competence Thus we are either in need of more powerful interventions for treating depression or we should aim at diminishing the likelihood of developing depression in the first place highlighting prevention of depression as a promising approach Recent research suggests that psychological preventive interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy CBT or interpersonal psychotherapy have the potential to prevent a clinically significant number of new depression cases A meta analysis of randomized controlled trials RCTs reported a reduced incidence rate for MDD of incidence rate ratio = confidence interval when comparing psychotherapy based preventive interventions with usual care or wait list conditions While the effectiveness of preventive interventions seems sufficiently documented it remains challenging to identify target populations that benefit most from preventive measures According to Cuijpers and colleagues two factors need be taken into account the impact and the effort of preventive measures An adequate impact means that prevention must lead to a substantial reduction of total disease burden Therefore a substantial proportion of new cases must be prevented if assembled risk indicators are fully blocked A reasonable level of effort is primarily defined as a low number needed to be treated NNT to prevent one new case of MDD Additionally persons at risk should be easily identifiable and interventions should not only be cost effective but also low priced to allow for their implementation at a population level From this viewpoint chronically medically ill patients appear to be a meaningful target population for the prevention of MDD given the substantially increased prevalence for MDD in this population compared to the general population In addition comorbid MDD in medically ill patients is associated with numerous negative implications such as problems in the physician patient relationship increased risky health related behaviors higher medical symptom burden medical complications lowered quality of life and increased mortality Within the group of medically ill persons back pain is one of the most common conditions and is associated with a two to three fold increased risk for MDD In addition depression is one of the core predictors of persistent pain symptoms increased pain related disability and poor treatment outcomes and is associated with increased morbidity and health care costs as well as diminished quality of life The benefits of prevention can be multiplied by focusing on patients who already show some depressive symptoms due to several reasons First subthreshold depressive symptoms are an additional risk indicator for MDD Multiple risk groups have increased specificity for prevention measures which leads to a reduction of NNT effort and leading to greater cost effectiveness of preventive interventions Second by lowering the NNT the number of persons who are not in need of a preventive intervention but receive it will be reduced Third subthreshold depression itself is a considerable disease burden for people affected and for society A successful preventive intervention will not only reduce the risk of developing MDD but also improve depression symptom severity at all levels of depression as shown by a recent meta analysis pooled effect size g = CI Fourth uptake rates of a depression prevention intervention may be higher in a target population of patients with depressive symptoms as treatment utilization was found to be associated with severity of baseline depression The internet is an appropriate prevention medium for scaling up preventive interventions as units of delivery are reasonably priced and can be easily administered It has several additional advantages as discussed elsewhere In prior studies Internet and mobile based interventions IMI have shown to be effective in the treatment of MDD as well as in the treatment of subthreshold depression indicating their potential to be utilized for preventive interventions Human support guidance has repeatedly been shown to have a positive effect on effectiveness of and adherence to IMIs The proposed study aims to investigate the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of an IMI eSano BackCare DP to prevent the onset of depression for chronic back pain patients PROD BP with subthreshold depressive symptoms The study will be embedded into routine orthopedic care in order to examine the intervention s effectiveness in an unselected sample of all eligible chronic back pain patients i e the implementation will not be limited to a self selected population of people who are already attracted to depression prevention interventions and the Internet It is expected that eSano BackCare DP is effective in preventing the onset of MDD compared to treatment as usual TAU over a month follow up period Compared to TAU eSano BackCare DP is superior in terms of a depression response b work capacity c quality of life d pain related disability and e pain intensity Furthermore the distributions of principal confounders in each group will be explored Methods Study design This project is a multicenter randomized controlled clinical trial RCT of parallel design comparing the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of a guided depression prevention IMI with treatment as usual TAU Fig All participants will receive TAU Participants of the intervention group will additionally receive the IMI eSano BackCare DP Fig Flow chart of inclusion and study procedure This clinical trial will be conducted and reported in accordance with the CONSORT supplement for pragmatic RCTs and the guidelines for executing and reporting internet based intervention research In order to guarantee data quality and safety the Clinical Trials Unit Freiburg will perform monitoring visits to the recruitment centres before during and after completion of the study Moreover an independent Data Safety and Monitoring Board DSMB has been established It consists of two experienced scientists and psychotherapists MH√§ MHa and a statistician LK with long standing experience in clinical trials Inclusion and exclusion criteria Patients who provide written consent will be included in the study if they meet the following criteria a age and above b presence of chronic back pain assessed by physician diagnosis and participants report on pain chronicity > months c sufficient knowledge of German language d internet access e persistent subthreshold depressive symptomatology Patient Health Questionnaire PHQ ‚â• in two consecutive screenings within weeks If only one PHQ is over cut off a third PHQ will be administered months later Patients will be excluded who meet DSM criteria for a current depressive episode or depressive episode within the last months following Kupfer b current dysthymia c current or lifetime bipolar disorder Additionally patients will be excluded in case of d participation in ongoing psychotherapy completed psychotherapy in the past months or being on a waiting list for psychotherapy beginning within months e currently suicidal or reporting suicidal attempts within the past years Patients with a diagnosis of any affective disorder will receive information on possible mental health care options including the offer to take part in a parallel clinical trial for the treatment of depression in patients with chronic back pain and clinical depression In cases of severe depression a trained psychotherapist from the study team HB SaS LS will contact the participant to initiate further actions Setting Recruitment Recruitment has started in October Recruitment will continue until the target sample size has been reached Participants are recruited in the aftermaths of their orthopedic rehabilitation care In order to increase the representativeness of our sample we established two comparable recruitment strategies First back pain patients from eight orthopedic rehabilitation units are screened at admission and discharge Clinical staff informs and recommends participation to patients screened positive personal recruitment In addition an information flyer and a patient information form with a detailed description of the study process and information on the intervention are provided Patients providing their informed consent are contacted by the study team in order to clarify further eligibility criteria by means of an online and telephone assessment including a telephone administered clinical interview SCID Second back pain patients from orthopedic rehabilitation units across Germany receive a letter with the same information flyer and study process information recruitment by letter Interested back pain patients fill out an online PHQ screening Positive screened patients PHQ ‚â• providing their informed consent conduct the aforementioned online and telephone assessment including a second PHQ screening to ascertain persistent depression in line with the first recruitment strategy second PHQ ‚â• A third PHQ screening takes place months afterwards in case of only one PHQ being screening positive Eligible back pain patients from both recruitment strategies receive an email providing further information and a link referring to the intervention website All participants are free to seek any additional help during the trial Trial participants receive for the completed follow up telephone assessment Randomization Participants eligible for inclusion will be randomly allocated to one of two groups intervention or TAU Randomization and allocation will be prepared in advance by a researcher SaS who is responsible for administration of the trial and participants This researcher will remain blinded to all processes within the intervention An automated web based randomization program will be used which features permuted block randomization variable block sizes of 8 randomly arranged and an allocation ration of Intervention Intervention condition The intervention eSano BackCare DP consists of six weekly sessions plus three optional modules and two booster sessions of approximately to min each see Figs Participants can decide when to complete the booster sessions at the end of the last session They can choose two dates within a timeframe of months following the intervention and will be reminded to log in again Sessions can be repeated as often as desired All modules consist of information about depression and chronic back pain provided by text audio and video as well as assignments metaphors and exercises The content of the intervention is based on cognitive behavioral therapy CBT for depression including elements of psychoeducation social skills problem solving behavioral activation improving self care relaxation and motivation for physical exercises The intervention is based on prior interventions that have been evaluated in a number of RCTs in different samples We adapted and substantially extended the predecessors to the context of depression prevention and chronic back pain In order to address chronic back pain patients specifically psychological pain intervention elements are integrated in every module of the intervention Moreover three optional modules are offered focusing on problems with sleep partnership sexuality and returning to the workplace Emphasis is laid on homework assignments which are intended to provide practice of learned skills To enhance patient adherence interactive elements quizzes conditional contents are implemented Participants will be asked about adverse events at the beginning of every session with the advice to check whether it is the right time to go on with the session The intervention platform is provided by Minddistrict a company specialized in the provision of web based health interventions Access to the platform proceeds through a unique username password combination and will be available on a basis All transferred data will be secured based on ISO27001 and guidelines NEN7510 Fig Fig Intervention content based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy CBT including back pain specific self management Text message coach At the beginning of the training participants are asked if they want to receive daily reinforcing text messages during the week training period Text message prompts have been shown to be beneficial in internet interventions with positive effects on efficacy and adherence The messages are sent automatically and coordinated with intervention content in order to integrate the learned techniques into daily life of the participants Message content aims at reminding patients to complete homework assignments repeating training content and reinforcing motivation of participants Guidance Trained and supervised by HB JL SP psychologists eCoaches will guide participants during the training by providing a semi standardized feedback within working days after each completed session using an eCoach manual The eCoach manual is standardized to ensure protocol adherence by the eCoaches All communication between eCoaches and participants runs via the intervention platform Guidance time spent per participant per intervention will be measured to provide data for the economic analyses of the project The feedback content will match the participants assignments and provide support for treatment adherence Feedback also includes positive reinforcement to encourage participants to continue with the training If any further questions arise participants and eCoaches can contact each other at any time via the intervention platform eCoaches will also send reminders to participants who do not complete intervention modules on time Control condition Participants of the control condition will have unrestricted access to TAU Although national treatment guidelines for low back pain and depression exist TAU following orthopedic rehabilitation care may vary There is no minimum treatment defined and TAU will not follow a standardized protocol however all received types of medical psychological help during the last months will be monitored with the Trimbos iMTA questionnaire to account for all costs associated with psychiatric illness TIC P Using these data an accurate description of TAU can be provided Sample size power calculation The aim of the study is to compare the effectiveness of the intervention against TAU using a cox regression survival analysis with a significance level of Based on previous studies of depression incidence in chronic back pain patients and subclinical depression we expect a mean incidence of MDD of in the control group within the months follow up period Based on a prior conducted trial we assume an absolute risk reduction of with a respective hazard ratio of between treatment and control group at months after randomization A total of events event = onset of depression need to be observed to detect a decrease in hazard hratio = of the treatment group relative to the hazard of the control group based on a power of Accordingly participants per group need to be randomized calculated using Stata SE The inclusion of relevant baseline predictors of depression onset will further increase power e g baseline depression severity Recruitment will be continued to allow for an expected attrition rate of Assessments Assessments will be conducted at pre treatment T0 and at weeks and months follow up T1 T2 T3 see Table All self report assessments potentially effect modifying covariates and demographic variables will be provided using a web based interface integrated into the intervention platform Section A Affective Syndromes of the SCID the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression HAM D and the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology QIDS C16 will be performed via telephone interviews at T0 and T3 Moreover we translated the SCID V RV into German to be able to comment on DSM IV and V diagnoses Table Variables TI SRQ SCID TI MR x AQol D Assessment of Quality of Life CSQ Client Satisfaction Questionnaire EQ D L European Quality of Life scale HAM D Hamilton

assessments to enhance compliance with completing measures In psychological intervention trials blinding of study participants and eCoaches is not possible However all members of the research team conducting telephone administered outcomes will remain blinded Therefore both participants and interviewers will be reminded of the reason and importance of blinding at the beginning of each interview Moreover performance bias will be minimized as the web based intervention is separated from other health care services Procedure on suicidal ideation The telephone interviews SCID HAM D QIDS and questionnaires PHQ include a suicide screening to identify participants who are currently suffering from suicidal ideation We will follow a suicide protocol adapted from prior trials if participants score on any suicidality item Participants who report low suicidal ideation HAM D QIDS or PHQ item score = will receive an email with detailed information on available health services and the advice to seek professional help if symptoms increase If participants express moderate to high suicidal ideation during the assessment or express any suicidal thoughts or intentions to their eCoach a trained psychotherapist from the study team EM LS HB SaS will contact the participant and initiate further actions Outcome measurements Primary outcome Time to onset of MDD To assess the time to onset of MDD within the month follow up period the depression related modules of SCID will be part of the telephone assessment The SCID is a comprehensive structured interview designed to be used by trained interviewers for the determination of mental disorder diagnoses according to the definitions and criteria of DSM It enables a reliable valid and efficient assessment of depressive disorders Inter rater reliability of the SCID was reported to be moderate to high and high for inter rater reliability comparing telephone and face to face interviews Interviewers are trained and weekly supervised by clinical psychologists LS EM and are blinded to randomization condition After the training period supervisors and the interviewers assess participants together with comparison of results as follows The Inter Rater Reliability IRR for the SCID measured by Cohen s kappa and the Intra Class Correlation for the HAM D and QIDS An almost perfect Cohen s kappa ‚â• and an excellent ICC coefficient ‚â• are considered as sufficient Moreover the interviewers are compared to each other on a random basis to assess the IRR Time to onset of MDD will be assessed using life charts Therefore life events will be recalled using a calendar method to determine presence of symptoms at each month within the follow up period Supervisors are blinded to participants group allocation Secondary outcomes Depressive symptoms Depressive symptoms will be assessed by the self administered Patient Health Questionnaire PHQ a telephone based clinician rating of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression HAM D and the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology QIDS The PHQ is a well validated and widely used depression screening instrument and has also been evaluated to be delivered as online version The item HAM D is the most widely used clinician rated measure of depression severity and as such viewed as the gold standard for the assessment of depression severity The Item QIDS will be used to further validate the depressive symptom outcome measures It covers all criterion symptom domains of the DSM for diagnosing a MDD HAM D and QIDS are administered to determine depression response Quality of life To assess health related quality of life the Assessment of Quality of Life AQoL D will be used which includes items assessing the following dimensions independent living mental health coping relationships pain and senses Besides measuring health related quality of life the AQoL D is suitable for economic evaluations of health programs and has good psychometric properties It has also shown to be reliable with a Cronbach s alpha of Because this is a relatively new instrument we additionally will use the EuroQol EQ D L the most widely used quality of life assessment as a basis for cost utility analyses The EQ D measures five health domains of importance to quality of life mobility self care usual activities pain discomfort and anxiety depression The level version includes five levels of response which has been found to be more discriminative and to reduce ceiling effects compared to the level version Pain intensity and pain associated disability Pain intensity and pain related disability will be measured following the IMMPACT recommendations for core outcome measures for chronic pain clinical trials Pain intensity will be measured by an point numerical rating scale of pain intensity as well as categorical classification of pain intensity none mild moderate severe The Oswestry Disability Index ODI will be used to assess pain related disability The ODI is a reliable and valid self assessment questionnaire including items Pain self efficacy Self efficacy with regard to pain management will be assessed by using the Pain Self Efficacy Questionnaire PSEQ which is a validated and reliable internal consistency Œ± = item instrument that assesses self efficacy expectations related to pain Work capacity Work capacity will be assessed using the German version of the Subjective Prognostic Employment Scale SPE a validated item self report questionnaire with high internal consistency Guttman scaling rep = Intervention satisfaction and adherence Patient satisfaction with the intervention will be measured by using an adaptation of the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire CSQ German ZUF optimized for the assessment of client satisfaction with online interventions CSWIQ The CSQ is a validated item instrument with high internal consistency Œ± = The adapted version validated for the assessment of client satisfaction in web based interventions has been shown to have high internal consistency in a range of studies Œ± = and is associated with treatment adherence and outcome The attrition rate i e percentage of participants who no longer use the intervention assessed by their log in data will give an estimate of the participants intervention adherence Side effects of psychotherapy The German version of the Side Effects of Psychotherapy Inventory INEP will be used to measure side effects of psychotherapy The INEP consists of items assessing a range of common changes participants may have experienced due to the effects of the preventive intervention in their social and work environments Costs To measure costs the Dutch cost questionnaire Trimbos Institute and Institute of Medical Technology Questionnaire for Costs Associated with Psychiatric Illness TiC P adapted for the German health care system will be used The TiC P is a widely used self report questionnaire to measure health care consumption and productivity loss We further adapted the questionnaire for the population of chronic back pain patients Participants will register all direct health service uptakes during the last months e g the number of general practice visits sessions with psychiatrists and hospital days In addition productivity related costs will also be assessed This includes the number of work loss days absenteeism the number of work cut back days presenteeism and costs associated with for domestic tasks Estimated development costs as well as opportunity costs will be included in the economic evaluation Covariates As potentially effect modifying covariates demographic variables gender age education social support and medical variables prior pain and depression treatments will be assessed via self report at baseline Internet competencies will be assessed by the Internet Affinity Scale The translated version by Haase and colleagues will be used Back pain type severity and chronicity will be extracted from medical records Statistical analysis Clinical analyses All analyzes will be performed according to the intention to treat ITT principle Kaplan Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard regression analysis will be used to determine differences in time to onset of MDD in weeks between both study conditions over a follow up period of months The dependent variable will be time to onset of MDD and treatment condition will be the independent variable The proportional hazards assumption will be tested based on the scaled Schoenfeld residuals test Survival analysis assumes that censoring i e a participant is lost to follow up or completes the follow up period without experiencing a major depressive episode is non informative Non informative implies that the reasons why participants drop out of the trial are unrelated to the study condition i e participants in one study arm should not be routinely censored We will apply the following methods to deal with informative censoring if necessary a imputation techniques for missing data b sensitivity analyses to illustrate best and worst case scenarios to test the robustness of the base case findings and c the use of the drop out event as a study end point In addition the number needed to treat NNT to prevent one additional event in the intervention group versus the control group will be calculated Covariates will first be checked whether they are associated with the primary outcome if not left out of the final analysis Secondary outcomes will be analyzed using hierarchical linear modeling To examine potentially moderating covariates correlation of covariates and outcome parameter are analyzed using multiple regression models In addition per protocol analysis will be performed to investigate the influence of drop outs on study results Missing data will be imputed using multiple imputation Potential confounding factors between source population and study population will be assessed which enables us to evaluate the external validity of the sample Finally characteristics of dropped out participants at follow up will be inspected and resulting socio demographic differences between intervention and control group will be described A significance level of p ‚â§ will be set for all analyses Economic evaluation Baseline utilities and costs will be compared between both groups and if necessary statistical techniques will be used to adjust for baseline differences In the cost effectiveness analysis the incremental cost effectiveness ratio ICER will be presented as costs per depression free year DFY gained DFYs will be based on the number of depression free weeks up to onset of a major depressive episode within the month follow up period The ICER in the cost utility analysis will be stated as costs per quality adjusted life year QALY gained Non parametric bootstrapping times will be applied to estimate the robustness of the ICERs and to quantify the uncertainty around the ratios The bootstrapped replicates of the ICERs will be graphically represented in a cost effectiveness plane with effects along the horizontal axis and costs along the vertical axis In addition a cost effectiveness acceptability curve will be graphed to assess the probability that the intervention is more cost effective relative to treatment as usual at varying willingness to pay WTP ceilings Discussion This study will be the first to investigate the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of a psychological Internet and mobile based intervention for the prevention of depression in a chronic pain population Due to its recruitment strategy from routine medical health care the entire potential target group can be reached within a naturalistic setting Results will have implications for researchers health care providers and public health policy makers Conducting IMI trials commonly involves possible limitations which we try to overcome using the following measures First web based interventions can have moderate to high drop out rates and drop out rates can be expected to be even higher in preventive interventions due to the lower symptom burden of participants We will approach this problem in different ways a by focusing on patients with current depressive symptoms b by providing guidance via eCoaches which has been shown to have an adherence facilitating effect and c by explicitly facilitating at risk participants motivation to use the intervention after discharge from orthopedic rehabilitation care In a prior IMI with diabetes patients participants completed an average of of all sessions In a sample of subthreshold depressed patients participants completed an average of These results correspond to findings from a recent meta analysis on adherence to internet based CBT ICBT Van Ballegooijen and colleagues concluded that adherence to guided ICBT could be equal to adherence to face to face CBT Participants do not necessarily have to complete all sessions to benefit from IMIs They may also stop the treatment because they have recovered or experienced improvement in symptoms thereby reducing the likelihood of developing depression These cases would represent a prevention success rather than a treatment drop out A second limitation of most Internet and mobile based trials to date including those mentioned above are their highly selective online recruitment strategies This may explain the promising results concerning drop out rates as participants already connected to the Internet comprised the intervention groups As a down side however those recruitment strategies lead to a lack of external validity In our study we address this problem through the integration of the intervention into routine care Thereby the entire potential target group will be offered the opportunity to take part in the preventive intervention The two different recruitment strategies will allow for analyses on different dissemination and implementation strategies of IMIs into routine healthcare Thus we can estimate what kind of patients and to which extent make use of the offer to take part in a preventive IMI within the whole group of chronic back pain patients Third IMIs can have negative side effects For this reason we followed the key recommendations of Rozental and colleagues We increased the flexibility of the treatment schedule by giving participants the possibility of delay at the beginning of each session and increased flexibility of therapist contact for patients Additionally we prolonged treatment duration by adding two booster sessions after the main treatment modules Furthermore negative side effects of treatment will be assessed on a regular basis and reasons for drop out from intervention will be assessed The specific strengths of this study are the following a Prevention studies are regularly methodologically limited because they lack a diagnosis at baseline and or follow up By carrying out the SCID prior to study start and at months follow up a high content validity can be ensured b With a target sample of participants the study will be optimally powered overcoming the small scale trial limitations of most prior prevention studies Following the ITT principle contributes to reducing overestimation of clinical effectiveness c The intervention is specifically tailored to the special needs of the target group of chronic back pain patients This has been discussed as having an uptake and adherence facilitating effect We aim to further facilitate adherence through the integration of the intervention into patients routine healthcare which enables clinicians to inform participants about the characteristics and effectiveness of IMIs This may have a positive impact on their acceptance d Using the internet as the medium for prevention might allow for scaling up of preventive interventions on a public mental health level e The direct implementation of the intervention into the health care system increases external validity in contrast to prior RCTs High prevalence rates underscore that the integration of depression prevention into curative care systems for the medically ill is one of the major emerging global health challenges If this study the first of its kind shows to be effective the intervention could be implemented into general chronic back pain and mental health treatment protocols as well as adapted to other chronically ill patient groups thus helping to reduce the disease burden of depression for both affected persons and society Thus the results of this study will be of major public

experience under the sun is new time is a long and stately thing passing with a gargantuan battleship slowness An hour in a doctor s waiting room restlessly leafing through magazines and studying the walls becomes a hobby in itself Every school day is a lifetime All this was written on Wayne Parkin s face as they made their way toward the witches house He carried a bottle of steak sauce in one hand and a bottle of ranch dressing in the other Thunder mumbled to itself somewhere in the east disconsolate testy as if the storm had gotten lost on the way The iron sky roiled slowly like a dying snake threatening rain The bottles felt like offerings Robin walked alongside him peering up at the sky I should ve brought umbrellas Something about the way their shoes scuffed across the packed dirt made Robin think of a western of outlaws and high noon duels Be on your best behavior Leon told his son He carried the steaks in a glass casserole dish Are they going to turn us into frogs No Robin had turned the GoPro back on but instead of wearing it herself she d made Wayne the designated cameraman and he wore it on his chest with the nylon harness The camera s red eye burned like a cigarette cherry in the darkening daylight Witches don t do that she said that s a fairytale Love potions flying on brooms talking mirrors that s all Disneystuff The good ones don t hurt you she thought They make you forget so they don t get hurt The hacienda seemed to grow as they approached it beyond the aspects of perspective as if it were swelling lengthening rising and suddenly she realized how very tall it was and how much of the property was bound by the adobe privacy wall The fa√ßade towered over them at three stories when had it become three she thought and then another six or seven feet for the bell s arch Gothic wrought iron spikes rimmed the top of the wall and weeping willows on the other side of the wall obscured most of the front porch It looks so out of place this far east doesn t it asked Leon Like a Mexican fort Bigger than I thought it was It s less of a house and more of of a compound I guess you could say It wasn t always this ominous thought Robin I don t remember it looking this fortress like As a little girl she had played among its trellises and hidden in its vines and made chalk drawings on the adobe walls of the hacienda She didn t remember the spikes on top of the garden wall in her childhood it had been smooth enough up there she could climb the oak tree and walk along the top of the wall balancing with her arms straight out while Grandma Mary watched her from the living room And when she jumped down into the gravel with a jarring CRUNCH she would look up through the front window and see Grandma Mary sitting on the sofa applauding her dismount Happier days She wondered how much of her childhood memory was implanted and erased At this point in her life she had given a lot of thought to what her mother had done and eventually she came to the conclusion Annie Martine had a mind Gift like Cutty and to a certain degree Weaver But where Cutty s power involved her mind telekinesis scrying things of that nature Annie s gift was more like Weaver s in that it was about influencing the minds of others Erasing memories Implanting memories Out of all the witches Robin had hunted and killed in the intervening years Annie s Gift was unique On paper fiddling with memories didn t sound that scary or insidious but in practice it could be used to gaslight someone until they were utterly under your control and experienced reality in whatever fashion you saw fit You could convince an innocent man they had committed some crime such as murder or if they were already criminals you could wipe their minds clean nothing to confess to No loose ends Or you simply drove them mad Flames licked inside a gas grill standing on the patio by the house visible through a gap in the lid Ten years before that had been a smaller charcoal grill the clamshell top the same candy apple red as a new sports car Robin had a sense memory of Theresa pouring beer over the patties as they cooked the Dos Equis sizzling on the coals the smell deep and ashen and thick Well hello there Speak of the devil A heavyset woman stepped outside to greet them Her olive skin contrasted richly against the starchy white of her festive peasant dress which was trimmed in red and blue Gold jewelry lay across her cleavage My name is Theresa she said in a Louisiana drawl Theresa LaQuices And you must be Mr Parkin Mistah Paaaahkin It s so nice to meet you Likewise said Leon This is my son Wayne Theresa pressed a hand to her bosom flashing a fistful of gaudy rings Oh I know who this little gentleman is Why I m the one carried him from the fairgrounds out to the road where the ambulance could get to him We are already well acquainted even though he don t rightly know it Even though Robin couldn t imagine a witch doing something so helpful she could see the muscular Theresa toting Wayne around as if he were a bouquet of roses Robin had found herself scooped up in those titanic arms a time or two in her own childhood She had always been a behemoth of a woman but the last time Robin had seen her she was merely heavy Ford tough her father Jason said about her after he first met their new neighbors which made his wife burst out laughing and square shouldered Workman s hands thick Bilbo Baggins feet Now Theresa s ungainly mass seemed almost pathological a hairs breadth from monstrous Her fists were small and clubby like dolls hands but her forearms were ham hocks Her shoulders sloped like mountain sides and her forehead was a broad smooth carapace The witch seemed invulnerable and constant a fixture in the earth Gesturing toward Robin with the steak dish Leon began And this is my new friend Oh I m well aware of who this young lady is Well awaya she was I didn t expect to see you here I ll admit Little Miss Martine I ain t seen you in a dog s age You ain t here to start no shenanigans today is you Theresa put her fists on her considerable hips and peered from under her thick black eyebrows It won t come to nothin mind you but all the same I d really rather not have to put up with it This ain t nothin but a friendly Sunday dinner between neighbors No Robin shook her head glancing at the ground I m just here to eat and talk to Marilyn I feel like we ve got too much history for me to bust in guns blazing A dinner truce hunh The old woman squinted assessing her then turned and trundled across the driveway toward the house How easily the old woman seemed to walk across the jagged gravel as if it wasn t even there Theresa had on a pair of slippers like nothing more than dainty satin bags on her feet and the stones she trod on seemed no more consequential than cotton batting Be sure you keep it that way I been puttin together a mighty nice repast and I d hate to see it ruined by a jackass Jack ayass Leon wheezed Muttley like laughter When Robin was last there the cabinets were painted in farmhouse blues and whites the fridge was an ancient freezer top Frigidaire and the floor was perpetually grimy linoleum in a brown cobblestone pattern But now the place was all brushed steel and travertine tile everything polished to a high gleam The fridge was an enormous side by side If she didn t know any better she d think she d stepped into a showroom at a home improvement store Leon whistled leaving the casserole dish on the counter Nice place you got here Thankee much said Theresa She cracked the oven dooropen to check on something then headed back outside to the grill and opened it Gray charcoal glowed subtly in the evening light Marilyn s in the garden if you want to visit while I knock the hooves off this beef Robin hesitated taking Leon and Wayne aside You two drew your algiz like I told you to do right Yep Yeah I guess said Leon Theresa snorted smirking as she laid the steaks over the coals with her bare hands Do what thou wilt she seemed to be thinking for all the good it s gonna do ya The patio occupied the top of the driveway a large area about the size of a basketball court separating the back of the house from the two car garage An adobe privacy wall like the one that enclosed the front garden ran clear out to one side all the way to the treeline some eighty or ninety yards out A tall wooden gate allowed them into the back garden Inside the wall they were greeted by rows and rows of trellis fences crawling with sickly ivy Grapes withered in clusters A vineyard said Leon Man I could go for some wine Sitting at a table in the freshly mown grass were Marilyn Cutty and Karen Weaver a large wooden pub style table with a white linen tablecloth thrown over it Marilyn slouched down in a chair with one elbow on the table nursing a glass of what looked like iced tea and staring out into the pinewoods Seeing them together sent Robin reeling backward through the years to afternoons spent trying to master croquet with Grandma Mary and her ancient hand me down mallet and balls sharing handfuls of blueberries from the bushes by the east wall Mornings in the cornflower blue kitchen making cat head biscuits with Theresa and stealing chocolate chip cookies out of the Premium Saltines tin in the pantry Late nights pretending to be a mannequin while Karen pinned a dress around her tiny frame If you re gonna be hangin around here like a damned beggar I might as well put you to work the old woman would tell her lifting her up and standing her on a stepladder Now don t move or I m gonna poke you She ain t your grandmother chastised Annie s twisted voice in the back of her mind This ain t your house Robin twitched as she heard a spectral echo of the meaty drumming impact her mother s body made when it hit the wooden floor in the foyer of the Victorian Witches her lying mother had warned her about them as she died with a broken neck Instead of wiping her mind squeaky clean as she d always done before Annie s final warning broke the spell poured all those missing memories back into her filling in all the vacant puzzle pieces Having her mother s memory wipe undone and all those clues and whispered secrets surging back in had inadvertently driven her insane It had taken a long time to overcome and here she was again in the thick of it As the misfits came shushing across the close cropped grass Weaver stood Hi there Then she noticed Robin Oooooh it s you I thought I told you to vamoose Y know I don t remember you being this stupid I m hard to vamoose And yes I m plenty stupid Wild haired Weaver had on a witchy looking petticoat made out of a hundred silk scarves of as many dark colors all tied together It might have been ragged were it not so artfully arranged She pushed up her sleeves Was the illusion not enough to run your ass outta here I can conjure up some real flies you know Big nasty ones that bite Excuse me said Leon I assume our self proclaimed witch hunter here has taken it upon herself to unload all her knowledge on you including her gory internet videos A man said in one of my mother s favorite books First comes smiles then lies Last is gunfire Robin put up her hands to demonstrate they were empty For the sake of transparency and trust I think it behooves all of us to skip the polite make believe I m not here to fight Just talk A palaver eh The hunter comes to parley Cutty folded her arms Yes Well the truth will out I ve always heard so there s no reason to tell lies when we can keep it at smiles and I think we could all do without the gunfire You didn t bring that nasty silver dagger did you I d be hard pressed to observe the rules of parley if you showed up packing the Godsdagger No It s in a safe place Cutty simply nodded slowly agreefully her eyes darting around the tabletop before meeting the girl s once again I ve been told what you are said Leon I m still not sure I believe it one hundred percent but I am informed And after what happened Friday night and yesterday morning y know with the snakebite and all I m also not convinced violence is necessary so consider me the dove of peace in this here scenario yeah I really appreciate what Miss Weaver here did for us and I d like to avoid bloodshed Her hands still raised like Madam Mim Weaver looked back and forth between them Truce then Truce said Cutty Truce said Robin For today For today The witch in the ragged petticoat lowered her hands dejectedly Wayne looked as if he were about to jump the fence and bolt I guess I knew you were going to come eventually Weaver sighed shaking down her sleeves The bracelets and beads around her wrists rattled I d hoped you d a been smart enough not to The three of them took a seat at the table and Weaver sat back down with what was probably a whiskey For some reason Maryhas taken a liking to you and your murdering backstabbing coward whore of a mother and I ve tried to honor that because of our history and all You didn t make a bad seamstress dummy after all But don t give me a reason to turn you inside out Cause I don t give a tin shit I ll do it Your skill at diplomacy has not waned in the least I see said Cutty Diplomacy is for cowards Thunder mumbled again to the east The evening was darker than it ought to be for six o clock although a hard blue luminescence lingered on the western horizon Humid air made soft halos around the candle flames like lamps in London fog I m surprised you guys want to eat outside Leon said studying the sky Looks like rain Nah said Weaver How do you know He fidgeted a coy smile on his lips that betrayed the anxious look in his eye Did you see it in the knucklebones or tea leaves or something Nope It just don t rain round these parts unless I say it can She smiled On the other side of the parking spaces at the end of a row of empty slots was an old Ford pickup truck A camper shell covered the bed like a turtle the same brick red as the body The self declared master of hide and seek was looking for a place to hide and this was the coolest possible place to hide in the entire apartment complex What grabbed little Delilah s attention was the bright green snake Diamond shaped scales uncoiled across the truck s body from door to door Each scale shone with its own sharp gleam reflecting some source of light beyond the ken of the canvas At the leading end of the dragonesque body was a great mouth full of teeth and writhing tongue dominated by white fangs the size of bananas One screwhead eye gazed out at her as big as her fist the color of honey Screwing it out she discovered the gasoline receptacle underneath The gas cap was the snake s eye How clever Walking around the back she found the body stretched across the tailgate went behind the passenger taillight and came out again on the passenger fender After that it coiled twice and clinging tightly to the very tip was a bare chested woman in Viking garb her giant boobs squeezed between her outstretched arms The barbarian Barbie gripped the last slender inch of the snake s tail as if it were a baseball bat and dug in with both heels It was a bit of a ratty truck to have such a gloriously cheesy picture painted on it The girl wondered who it belonged to and what he was like as she reached up and put her hand on its metal belly still warm withthe day s beating The barbarian s bulging arms winecork nipples and glowing lightning god eyes stood out from the truck body around it a paint depth bas relief I m coming to find youuuu Ginny called from somewhere to her distant right shouting in a singsong voice Lifting the rear sash Delilah climbed into the bed of the truck letting it sigh back down on pneumatic hinges Crammed against the front of the cargo space was a fluffy black bale of pine needles Many of the needles had slipped out and now coated the floor of the truck bed with a thin crunchy carpet Inside the camper shell the air seemed sapped of oxygen stifling hot grainy with the smell of earth and bitter pine The side windows were painted over with the red of the body coloring the light from the streetlamps a boudoir crimson To Delilah s right as she climbed in was a burlap sack with fertilizer stenciled across the front full of something large bulbous as big as the girl herself Next to that was a Stihl weed eater with a well gnawed line encrusted with grass and reeking of gasoline A gardener man she thought duck walking over to the bale of pine needles and settling down beside it I wonder if he plants tulips She loved tulips loved the light sweet smell of them I m going to find you said Ginny from somewhere in front of the truck It had been parked facing the apartment building with the rear pointing at the dark street Delilah could hear the little girl s new shoes clopping along the pavement as she skipped from car to car Ah ha No I guess not Delilah froze in place and slowed her breathing Her belly rose and fell under her T shirt and she pinched the seams of her jeans anticipating her discovery in the hot dark camper studying the rough denim with her fingertips as she listened Are you in here Ginny asked A car door opened with a metallic crackle A couple of heartbeats passed Nope The door slammed shut ker tunk Sitting there in the gas smelling dark Delilah strained at the limit of her hearing pine needles poking through her jeans She slid an inch to her left as quietly as possible and pressed herself against the bristly straw bale Ginny sounded closer She gave a surfer like Whoa and walked right up to the snake truck Check that out Delilah could hear her creeping around the vehicle taking in the entirety of the artwork A tiny hand trailed down the side of the panel with a susurrant hiss that sounded more snake like than Delilah wanted to admit She shifted to get away from a pine needle poking her and rested her feet against the burlap sack Whatever was inside the bag was solid Whatever it was it wasn t fertilizer Whoa Ginny said again this time from the passenger side of the truck She giggled Look at those boobies She looks like Thor Delilah could hear her breathing even over her own Ginny was a tall Nordic little blonde girl that never had any trouble clearing her plate at dinner and stayed stocky and moon faced even though she was an active kid and played kickball Delilah could see Ginny in her mind s eye swiping a wispy lock of hair out of her big pink grinning face A voice called from the apartment building Regina Time to come in Ginny sighed Okay Mama she called back Delilah thought about popping out to surprise her but realized she could reuse this spot next time Why ruin it now Okay Lilah You can come out now shouted Ginny I have to go back in Waiting until Ginny had left Delilah stayed quiet She really was a ninja She had gone undetected She got up off the floor of the bed and crouched there in the womblike red shadow striking a kung fu pose Kyah She whispered spirit shouts to herself Kyah Eeyah She threw a punch and then another with the other hand then tried to kick but the low ceiling didn t give her enough room to maintain her center of balance so she fell back on her butt She caught herself with her hands raking the inside of her forearm down the rock chipped edge of the weed trimmer head Ouch Her hand landed on some angular object inside the burlap bag It was flat on one side She raised her arm into the dim light and saw that the trimmer hadn t broken skin but there was a painful four inch red welt Tugging back the rim of the burlap sack Delilah saw a New Balance tennis shoe Time ground to a halt Even the cicadas silenced themselves though not all at once dwindling to three or four and then one buzzing razz tapered off into nothing All thought of ninjas fled her mind She was a seven year old girl again bewildered and vulnerable and alone Fear didn t quite enter into it not yet Some lingering logic said the bag was full of old hand me down shoes a load of clothes destined for Goodwill Maybe the owner of the truck was a good hearted man that collected old giveaways for the church or something She pressed her fingertips against the burlap sack again and felt another shoe inside Good A big bag of shoes for the church She relaxed and peeled the bag open a little bit more Wrapped in a striped sock a skinny ankle protruded from the mouth of the shoe pale hairless Delilah s mouth moved but nothing came out If something had come from her mouth it would have been Mama Mama Mama but for some reason her voice box didn t want to work the wind wouldn t catch the guitar strings her throat wouldn t respond She just kept mouthing the word over and over again Her legs didn t want to work either She wanted to get out of the truck to crawl over to the sash and push it open throw herself out of the camper shell and run home But she couldn t quite wrap her mind around the sight of seeing a little boy s legs poking out of a fertilizer bag in the back of a stranger s truck and it was the confusion that kept her frozen Instead of directing her feet to propel her outside her child brain could only spin in place trying to reconcile one with the other tires in deep mud She touched the leg Cold Dead cold This was incorrect untrue unreal It didn t make sense People didn t die like this People died in hospitals at a ripe old age and their family cried over them at the funeral home people in cheap gray suits and bifocals They were buried in cemeteries with flowers and pretty headstones with carvings of angels and animals You don t walk on graves That s rude Miss Delilah Lee Go round them Are you okay in there The words came out wrong Strangled wet She touched her own face and realized she was crying Boy Are you oh Are you okay Taking the edge of the sack opening in both hands she pulled it up up up past the boy s knees He was wearing a pair of black gymshorts She would have kept going but the sack was caught on the toe of his shoe With a terrified respect Delilah pulled the burlap back down covering the boy s legs and started sobbing outright The inside of the painted over camper swam in red chaos a hot box full of blood and she went for the back sash Nothing there but a round hole where the handle was supposed to be For the second time in as many minutes reality ceased to color inside the middle of the sash looking for the handle but it wasn t there The only thing marking its prior presence was the round hole in the sash frame Inside she could see the mechanism that operated the latch but she couldn t figure out how to move the parts In the cab of the truck someone sat up in the passenger seat She became moveless and silent unwilling to give herself away a fawn in the grass The man fetched a heavy sigh and unlatched the cab s rear window sliding it open He twisted in the seat and peered inside a silhouette crowned with a shock of fiery copper hair She couldn t quite see his face but his head was big He had the affect of a pit viper with a wide set jaw and narrow throat Hey there said the man His voice was dry and high like sandpaper like the scraping of sandstone vaults Delilah said nothing I know you re back there your friend woke me up looking for you Delilah s burning eyes refused to blink She was afraid to take them off the wide headed shadow in the front seat Snot crept down her upperlip What s your name he asked Nothing Not talkin huh I can dig it he said emphasizing the phrase with a brief jazz hand Smart Y know when I was your age I was great at hide and seek Nobody could find me I knew all the best hiding places My friends called me Snake cause I could wriggle into the littlest places Liah said the girl She hunkered against the tailgate shivering Hmm My name is Delilah Delilah the man said pleasantly Pretty name Mine s Roy Maybe I can teach you a few things about hiding huh You don t want to jump in the back of a crazy lookin truck like this one This is a bad place I can show you where to hide where no one will ever ever find you again He put a ziptie between his lips and let it dangle there as if it were a wheat straw in a cowboy s mouth Delilah thought it looked like a snake s tongue Deet deet The stillness was broken by an electronic alarm Roy took a phone out of his pocket and studied it the screen illuminating his face His nose was pointed his nostrils wide his eyes thin and somehow both clever and stupid at once As he read the message his mean slash of a mouth formed silent words Looks like I need to get back to the house No rest for the wicked His eyes flashed up to Delilah and he got out of the truck The camper sash opened with a creak allowing cool night air to pour in like fresh river water and the man scowled in at her Out of the truck princess said Roy jerking a thumb over his shoulder Game s canceled Delilah clambered over the tailgate and stumbled onto the pavement Leaning over her the red headed man smiled Run on home And if you tell anybody I was here well I know where you live And I promise you you don t want to play hide and seek with me I know where you live Getting back into his truck Roy regarded her with those tiny venomous eyes Stay outta strangers cars kid You ll live longer Copyright ¬© S A Hunt Pre Order Your Copy
10817,10817,"Originally Posted by Saddletramp You reached a lot in that post I quoted you on. Way to skip over it. You have to earn respect and you never have. Stop making up things and presenting strawman arguments if you want to start. I‚Äôve never read any of your posts (save for maybe a basketball take or two which I barely see you share) that I haven‚Äôt thought ‚ÄúMan, this guy‚Äôs takes suck‚Äù. If that puts your panties in a wad then take it as constructive criticism or take it as a hint. Or ignore it, I don‚Äôt care. But don‚Äôt complain that someone has a problem with your ****** posts when you make almost exclusively ****** posts. There were no strawman arguments. Even Indi understands now that I wasn't making the claims HE was the one saying the agencies were defunded. We are grown adults and figured the misunderstanding out, we don't need to agree in order to communicate. I have no problem if you disagree with whatever takes I put out. I'm not the one that acts out emotionally. I just expect more from you because I KNOW you're not a complete idiot. If you have a problem with a take of mine, stop being so vague and general and explicitly point to it. You've done it a couple times without acting hormonal. As for my basketball takes, I mostly come here for PSD games. I enjoy discussing/debating with those that play as well. Other than that, it is rare that I will post on here. As I said, if I talk about basketball, it's not very serious. I'd rather NOT ignore you and address anything you disagree with. I'm not afraid to disagree or to say maybe I'm wrong on something. Anyways, if whatever I've said about basketball in the past has offended you, I'll take this time to genuinely apologize as it was never my intention to make you angry or emotional over it."

This gives a silky look that allows make-up to be applied flawlessly. Which is perfect for brides. This treatment also so is amazing before a holiday for browner face. The treatment is pain-free and many clients have reported it is as a calm, relaxing experience. You can benefit from a one-off treatment for a special occasion or have a course of treatments as part of your regular skincare regime. (every 3-4 weeks) Dermaplaning does not alter the structure of the hair. Hair growth will return as it was before the treatment and WILL NOT grow back faster and thicker"

Peeps are one of my biggest obsessions so heck yeah, even better [emoji41][emoji41] Haha thanks! And yessss Peeps are amazing. I stocked way up around Easter because the pharmacy kept having sales. [emoji28] Started off with a little bit of smoked Earl Grey tea and a looooot of seltzer because it√¢¬Ä¬ôs hot and humid here. If you have sweetener drops you can put them in seltzer and it√¢¬Ä¬ôs like soda, which is awesome, because there are all these cool flavors. (I√¢¬Ä¬ôm a bad New Yorker and have betrayed Vintage for Polar, they have more interesting flavors lol.) Also healthy stuff: mini Persian cucumbers√¢¬Ä¬î unpictured plain and with Emeril honey mustard, champagne dill mustard, whole-grain Dijon, coarse grain mustard, and normal Dijon√¢¬Ä¬î and a carrot. The usual fat-free Reddi Whip canister. Creme br√É¬ªl√É¬©e rice pudding with cinnamon which I popped in the freezer for a bit. I lack air conditioning so I√¢¬Ä¬ôm resorting to creative measures to keep cool. [emoji23] RX bars. There√¢¬Ä¬ôs this limited summer orange flavor, which I tried for the first time and it√¢¬Ä¬ôs delicious! I had that, and chocolate hazelnut, and chocolate coconut. Here√¢¬Ä¬ôs a thing I baked on Monday, it√¢¬Ä¬ôs a miniature key-lime cake with walnuts. You can swap out butter/oil for lemon or lime curd if you√¢¬Ä¬ôre making a citrus cake because it already has butter or oil in it, and the end product tastes more natural than if you use an extract. Frosting is chocolate buttercream, with the last of my edible gold dust so I gotta get more of that. It was SO FREAKIN GOOD. Chocolate and citrus together slaps. [emoji106] I√¢¬Ä¬ôll probably be back tomorrow, my eating gets very weird when it gets super hot and sticky like this lol. Stay safe & take care of yourselves!

9141,9141,Link to Part Two The night was going splendidly Stephanie Mcmahon had beaten and humiliated two of the most annoying women in the WWE She proved that she was better than Bayley by turning her into her own personal table and proved to Sasha the real boss was by hanging her from a coat hook by her trunks An hour had passed and Stephanie was still having a great time She had placed a small stool under Banks whilst this made the wedgie slightly weaker allowing Sasha to stand on her tiptoes it meant that her trunks wouldn t rip meaning she couldn t get free Stephanie was having fun she used Bayley s big bubbly ass as a footrest whilst watching Smackdown Stephanie would also deviate to playing a fun game of pinging elastic bands at Sasha whilst she hung from the door Ouch Sasha yelped grabbing her ass cheek as she had woken up slightly after her two beatings Bullseye Stephanie celebrated as she pinged another band towards Sasha s other asscheek You re gonna pay for this Ouch Sasha yelled before being hit by another band trying to turn her head to Steph but her wedgie prevented her Funny people keep telling me that Mrs Mcmahon smirks as she kicks the stool out from under Sasha Oooohh you bitch Sasha groaned You should have left WWE when you went on your little sulk now you re gonna be my bitch Stephanie says as she gets some tape and puts it over Sasha s mouth to muffled cries That s better There is a knock on the door and Stephanie hears it open She turns to see a confused looking Rhea Ripley Ummm Hi Steph Rhea said looking over at Bayley and Sasha Did I say you could come in Stephanie yelled No sorry I It s what we do with Regal s office Does this look like Regal s office No Ma am Might i ask what s going on None of your damn business now leave He help Rhea Bayley murmured Shut It Stephanie shouted before bringing her hand down hard on Bayley s ass causing a yelp and for Bayley s ass to jiggle uncontrollably before placing some tape over her mouth Rhea saw the hand marks on the smackdown champs ass it had clearly been worked over for a while Rhea looked back at Steph whose top was still wet and shiny from the lube Sasha had squirted on it She saw Sasha hooked by her trunks to a hook on the door face and tits covered with cream and her ass marked with pen and red from strikes Steph I don t think this is how you should treat talent Stephanie turned face full of anger What was that Stephanie growled Well you know seems a bit Extreme Rhea said shyly Who are you to tell me how to treat my talent Stephanie yells I I m sorry I just thought I don t care Get out before I make you Stephanie says getting up in Rheas face Steph don t threaten Ow Rhea was met with a slap from an evil looking Stephanie who was feeling on top of the world Steph had a devious powerful smile on her face until Rhea turned her head back causing Steph s smile to fade to a look of fright You shouldn t have done that you bitch Rhea scowled She was bigger than Steph who had never seen that look of rage before Stephanie went for another slap but was caught by rhea who returned the favour The slap floored Stephanie who held her face and looked up in fear Stephanie tried to crawl away but Rhea grabbed the top of her skirt Stephanie kicked and wriggled making the skirt come loose Rhea yanked the skirt revealing Stephanie s small black thong her ass still shiny and pink from Sasha s spanking Rhea grabbed Stephanie by the top of her thong causing a painful wedgie Ow ow ow Rhea please Stephanie pleaded Let me go You should have thought about that before you slapped me you brat Rhea scowled She dragged Stephanie over to the bathroom and ripped her top open exposing Steph s huge tits She dumped Stephanie in the bath and turned the cold tap on spraying directly on Stephanie s tits and face As Steph tried to get up she kept slipping in the tub This allowed Rhea to fill a bucket with washing up liquid and water using the office sink Rhea turned the tap off and brought the bucket with a sponge over to Stephanie What the hell do you think your doing you stupid bitch Stephanie shouted as she again slipped over onto her stomach with her ass in the air which Rhea took the opportunity to give a hard slap causing Stephanie to yelp and slip around more Those aren t very nice words Steph what s that saying again Rhea smirked She grabbed Stephanie by their hair and a big bar of soap by the other She began shoving the soap in Stephanies mouth causing suds to pour out the Billiondollar princess face The bar is so big Stephanie is basically deep throating the soap Rhea then puts the soap down and sprays the shower head in Stephanie s mouth Rhea turns the water off as her adversary pants and spits out suds Stephanie is drenched as Rhea looks around the bathroom You know Steph it s kind of dirty in here could use a clean Rhea grabs the bucket of soapy water and throws it over Stephanie covering her entire body with suds with a small thong the only thing covering her Stephanie goes to swing before falling and smacking her boobs off the floor Rhea toyingly grabs the wet sponge and squeezes suds over Stephanie s ass and rubs it She then lifts Steph up by the hair slightly and wedges the sponge between her big tits Time for you to do some hard labour for once Rhea says as he lifts up Stephanie s legs so she s in a wheelbarrow position and uses her boss as a makeshift mop sliding her up and around the bathroom floor After she has slid Stephanie s tits over the whole floor Rhea picks up Stephanie whose hair is white with suds How about the toilet Surely that needs a clean too Rhea laughs as she grabs a worn down Stephanie and dunks her head in the toilet bowl and proceeds to flush as Steph struggles The amount of careers you and your family have put down the toilet Ironic huh Rhea grabs Stephanie s thong and pings it on her ass causing a small yelp before yanking her out of the toilet Stephanie s make up is now running down her face Eww Steph you don t look to good let me fix that Rhea grabs the bucket and places it over Stephanie s head she grabs a red felt pen that her adversary had used and draws a face with a frown and X s as eyes Stephanie tries to remove the bucket but it is stuck tightly around her head which Rhea didn t intend but laughs anyway Rhea rips off Steph s thong causing her boss to try and cover up this however results in her slipping over and hitting her bucket covered head against the bathtub knocking her out Rhea raises Stephanie up and drapes her prone over the bath Rhea looks around and grabs a red lipstick She writes Rhea s bitch on Stephanie s ass and then wedges the tube into her asshole for good measure Ok I think you ve learnt your lesson Rhea smirks as she picks Stephanie up over her shoulder she looks in the mirror and admires herself with Stephanie s vandalised ass next to her She pulls out her phone and takes a picture One for the gram Rhea walks over to Stephanie s cupboard and dumps her head first into it Rhea can t quite shut the door as Steph s big ass is in the way so she just leaves it Rheas goes to leave but then hears the muffled cries for help from Sasha and Bayley Rhea rips the tape off of both of their mouths Please Rhea help Sasha shouted Yeah Rhea come on No one can find us like this Rhea thinks for a moment then has an idea You two are the top dogs of the Smackdown women s division Right what a statement it would be from NXT if I were to leave my mark on you both Rhea rubbed her hands with a sadistic smile What No Help us Bayley pleaded Rhea walks up to Sasha and licks her face Mmmm is that cheesecake Rhea says mockingly she pulls Sasha backwards and swings her into the door by her wedgie dazing the Boston native What are you doing Bayley shouts Rhea ignores her and unhooks Sasha she walks over carrying Sasha and dumps her prone body across Bayley s back teasingly placing Sasha s motionless hand on Bayley s asscheek causing Bayley to try and wiggle it off but to no avail You idiot You ll never make it on the main roster You Stupid Whore We could ve helped oh shit Bayley halts as she sees Rhea rummage in Stephanie s fridge and proceeds to pull out two strawberry creampies which were being saved for Mr Mcmahon as well as a big looking cucumber Rhea walked up behind a fearful looking Bayley who tried to look back Rhea Please Think about this We came from NXT t Oooohhh Bayley moans as Rhea works the large cucumber into her asshole once mostly in Rhea then proceeds to lift Bayleys head by her hair and place one of the pies directly under the former hugger s face No Rhea ple Bayleys face gets dumped into the pie and all that can be heard are her muffled cries With the champ dealt with Rhea pulls down Sasha s trunks and smacks the other creampie right onto her ass Rhea grabs a piece of paper and writes THIS IS NXT on it in big capitals before sticking it to Sasha s sticky ass via the cream Rhea sits Stephanie back into her chair then looks around admiring the carnage and humiliation she had caused She smirks and leaves the others in the office to be later found and further embarrassed

2859,2859,From DGA org THE DGA INTERVIEW From Stage to Screen Rob Marshall the director behind Chicago Into the Woods and Mary Poppins Returns knows a thing or two about musicals thanks to his theatrical training and an ability to inspire by example By Steve Chagollan Rob Marshall represents an anomaly in Hollywood he s a director who specializes in musicals a volatile form that s been buried and revived so many times that most filmmakers are afraid to touch it Not Marshall He s to the manor born Instead of attending film school he took a more traditional route to the dramatic arts studying music theater at Carnegie Mellon University s School of Drama before becoming a professional dancer on Broadway Musicals are his life s blood he attended them growing up and participated in them as a cast member He witnessed how they were made from the inside out and his mentors including the director choreographer Graciela Daniele the legendary Broadway hoofer Chita Rivera and the producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron all saw the potential beyond his grace on the boards when an injury threatened to sideline his performance career As Marshall has recounted the first time he said action and cut was on a soundstage in Burbank directing Annie a made for TV musical that would foretell a long association with Disney live action that continues to this day His penchant is to turn fear of the unknown into a motivating force After his feature debut Chicago won six Oscars including best picture and a DGA Award for his direction he was showered with other musical offers But instead he went in the opposite direction from a burlesque backstage musical rooted in the American experience and filled with characters driven by fame and fortune to an intense period drama Memoirs of a Geisha that parts the curtains on a secret society of Japanese courtesans known for their modesty and discretion As in all of his work the production values were exquisite and his collaborators represented the cream of the crop pointing to a quality in Marshall s work that favors the classic studio approach to moviemaking with glamorous stars clear ethical underpinnings and hopeful resolutions Marshall spoke to the DGA Quarterly while prepping his latest feature a live action version of the Disney animated musical The Little Mermaid and another deep dive into the unknown given the technical feats required by both filming underwater and creating the illusion of it But there was nothing in Marshall s manner that suggested the daunting task ahead He appeared relaxed and confident characteristic of a man whose mantra of positive reinforcement has carried him far and surrounded him with top flight creative partners many of whom will follow him to the ends of the Earth DGAQ So I understand you have already begun rehearsals on The Little Mermaid MARSHALL Yes We have eight weeks of rehearsal and then we go into two weeks of pre records And then we have another week of prep as we gear up and start shooting I am just looking at my calendar right now March Q That s a significant amount of rehearsal time for movies is it not A Yeah well this one s so complicated it s the combination of it being a musical and also the underwater of it all has us having to do so much stunt work on rigs and wires and all of that kind of thing so that the whole part of it is incredibly complicated Of all the movies I have done I actually can say this is the most complicated by far Q Are you actually going to be filming underwater or is it going to be the illusion of being underwater A We are doing some underwater work especially to get the reality of that But the majority of it we are doing what s called dry for wet On a blue screen stage We are singing and moving and acting and underwater for half the film I will say it s sort of this new frontier We are working with a lot of fabulous visual effects artists with all kinds of new techniques to be able to do that kind of thing and make it really look photo real For instance on Ariel you are creating a tail and her hair because her hair has to move in the water and so that will be digitally added And then you are creating everything the water the backgrounds the vegetation the coral reefs the fish It s a challenge Q I have had such a great time rewatching your movies especially with all the negativity in the news Into the Woods in particular was so healing I was just enveloped by the sheer joy of this movie A That s so incredibly generous of you That means a lot to me I will say that for me there are many reasons to make certain films But I have felt in the past few years as you can imagine that to be able to disappear into a world like Sondheim s Into the Woods Lapine s Into the Woods or into the world of Mary Poppins it s been very therapeutic It s sort of like in the golden days of Hollywood musicals during the Depression era when people really needed to escape into a world where you can actually be lifted into a place I feel that great need these days Q Now The Little Mermaid will be your fifth musical And you have been credited for at least partially reviving the musical on the big screen And yet when it s not performed on stage it s always considered a risk Why do you think that is A It s a very dicey proposition on film It always has been because in the theater you are basically sitting in an artificial place where you can accept singing And so I feel like that proscenium a place that has a built in surreality it s much more acceptable to have people sing And film as we know is such a visceral medium It s such a very real medium in so many ways When I am working on a musical the biggest challenge for me is why they sing how they sing And I think you have to set the rules up right from the very beginning of a musical You have to really say OK this is what it s going to be these are the rules we are going to follow and you have to really stick to them And I always feel in a way that you have to earn a song even more importantly than you do in a stage musical It s that classic adage about musicals which is in a good musical when speaking is not enough you sing When moving is not enough you dance But it has to feel seamless If it does not feel seamless if it feels like Oh here they come they are going to start to sing It s awkward it feels slightly embarrassing and that s what you try to avoid It has to feel absolutely earned It has to feel organic I remember one of the struggles with Chicago was well how does that work I mean it was called Chicago A Musical Vaudeville all presentational vaudeville songs Now in a theater you can present them directly to an audience But in film there s a fourth wall and you can not So we had to create a world where there was something theatrical There had been talk about my choreographing eight years before and so I saw some early scripts And none of them dealt with the fact these were vaudeville songs that needed to be done on a stage I think people are nervous about doing numbers on a stage but when you look at the history of musicals for me some of the greatest numbers are done on a stage the backstage musicals every single song in the film Cabaret is done on a stage With Chicago it was discovering this conceptual idea and embracing it and that s how our musical was told Q And yet Into the Woods is a different animal A With something like Into the Woods that whole opening prologue is so helpful because we are basically telling this tale through song And so immediately you are saying This is how the story is being told and that was so helpful I remember when I sat down with James Lapine to work on it he was so great because he said Well you know we can throw anything away We can just like throw the whole prologue out and start again I said laughs That s the best part I said Do it almost verbatim to what it is on stage because what you have done it s very cinematic You are moving back and forth quickly quick quick cuts between all these different stories and you are telling the audience immediately This is how we are telling the story through song Q One of the things you do to add a measure of cinematic dimension to your musical numbers is parallel action In Nine there s more than one thing happening other than this song being sung These things are triggered by memory And there are flashes of fantasy A I think that way of layering a musical number is something you can do on film that s harder to do on stage That s one of the beauties of film I will say that it s very important to keep the story moving through a musical number If you just sit in a place where it s just an entertainment I think people check out I think the story has to continue which is why it s actually very helpful when you are doing a number to have different layers to place into the number to keep the story moving forward Because the story needs to be told in the song In fact that should be the meat of the scene So when I can cut away to something that continues the story in some way I feel like that kind of thing is so incredibly helpful when you are trying to tell a story through music Q Nine is this lavish art film in a way and it seems like it s as much an homage to Fellini as it is to a couple of other films about blocked directors at the end of their rope I am thinking of Woody Allen s Stardust Memories and Bob Fosse s All That Jazz Did those movies sort of creep into your consciousness as you were making this movie A Very much so I come from the theater and so Bob Fosse is a god to me So All That Jazz meant a lot to me and understanding that was a very dark film in many ways And the fantasies that he s experiencing and how they are interwoven into the piece it was very helpful for me as was Stardust Memories I got a beautiful email from Woody Allen who loved Nine And he was very generous about it very very very kind about it He did not reference Stardust Memories but I certainly was aware of that I certainly understand the beautiful chaos that filmmaking is and feeling inauthentic as you are working you know feeling dry and in Nine the character of Guido Contini this is a broken man Everything falls apart because he s ultimately spiritually and internally broken Thank you for saying that because it is very much sort of a small art film in a way but on a lavish scale Q The high level of craftsmanship is a throughline in your work dating back to Chicago You won the DGA Award for directing that film which is like winning the most valuable player award in your rookie season A I remember that night so well You have to understand when I made Chicago I honestly thought that a few people would see it kind of just have its little moment I had no sense what was ahead of me And I remember sitting at the DGA Awards with my partner John DeLuca and Ren e Zellweger and Salma Hayek were at the table Salma said I dreamt last night you were going to win I said Salma it s not happening She goes No I know these things And I just assumed it was going to be Scorsese for Gangs of New York who had never won a DGA Award at that point And I thought he should have had DGA Awards by then And when they called my name I did not move And I remember Ren e Zellweger turned to me and said You know you have to get up But it was sort of overwhelming because I just did not expect any of it I just remember when I went up there all I could do was talk about directors who had influenced me in my life like the ones we mentioned Bob Fosse Woody Allen but also the ones from the golden age of musicals the Stanley Donens and George Cukors and you know Vincente Minnelli and Robert Wise and those people I learned this artform from them I just never imagined I would be doing it Q You had come from the theater and you were established there but you were a newbie in the Hollywood ranks Did the Guild help you feel a little more at home A Yes because I was immediately accepted into this very exclusive club of great filmmakers who I admired In a way it s a small club There s just not a lot of filmmakers out there It s grown over the years But it felt incredibly inclusive And what I love is that camaraderie and I felt that from everyone and not looked down upon because I was coming from the theater or you know had not done movies It was more like We value good work And that s what I felt from everybody It was a wonderful place to be welcomed into Q And I would imagine at some point directors might have been coming to you for advice on directing a musical because they had never done that before Maybe even somebody like Bill Condon who wrote the adaptation of Chicago and subsequently directed Dreamgirls and Beauty and the Beast A With Bill it was really special because he was a huge fan of musicals but had never written one I obviously coming from musicals had never directed a feature film and I learned from him and he learned from me It was a wonderful back and forth And it s been lovely over the years to get calls from people who are doing a musical and you know How does this work And I just share my experiences But for me I actually used my theater training As we were just talking about moments ago I am in rehearsal on Mermaid The only difference about the rehearsal is instead putting it together in one big piece I am doing it like a mosaic in little small pieces The truth is there s so much about a musical on film that is created very similarly to a Broadway musical It s sort of in the DNA of it Because you have to learn choreography you have to learn blocking you have to work inside specifically in this film For instance all the stunt work and that kind of thing It s like working on two or three films at once You have an entire music department you have an entire choreography department And it all needs to pull together as if it s one seamless piece I guess one of the great things is that when a musical works people think it looks effortless Which it should Q On Chicago how did you manage to honor the spirit of Bob Fosse while also giving it your own directorial and choreographic stamp A I felt like you needed a central story to take us through and I felt that was through Roxie played by Zellweger So Bill Condon and I worked to find that central story of Roxie s and how it would come from her mind And immediately when you have done that you have something more cinematic and it pulls it off of the sort of stage work of it all And so this idea of it taking place in two different worlds as soon as you reconceive something then you have the freedom I mean the genius of Bob Fosse on stage you can kind of peel away because now you are serving something else You are serving a very large conceptual idea So that immediately frees you and that helped me a lot Q Tell me about how you approach the production values in your movies A One of my goals is to think in terms of classic filmmaking That s what inspires me So I try not to do something that s sort of like on trend I try to approach them in a way that feels somehow deeply connected to myself but also in a classic movie style that s truthful and authentic to what you are saying and doing and not try to gimmick something up I try not to serve myself I try to serve the piece That s the big part of it I do not think in terms of This is my film and I must put my stamp on it Q Well you have surrounded yourself with some master craftsmen Chicago also marked the beginning of some longstanding partnerships with Dion Beebe the cinematographer John Myhre the production designer and Colleen Atwood the costume designer Tell me about how you discovered those people and how that team came together A It happened on Chicago with Dion Beebe I was being asked to really look at very established directors of photography because the studio very much wanted to make sure that I was working with people who had done many films But I felt differently I did not want to feel like I was the young kid in the room working with this professional I needed a partner So when I found Dion and his work honestly the meeting came because I got his reel and I thought it was beautiful and artistic and crafted so exquisitely I just thought who is this person And it was this young cinematographer from you know South Africa Australia and we bonded immediately And it s very hard for me to make a film without him I have only made one without him Dion is a natural fit for me because he understands movement of the camera and we share a very similar aesthetic He s connected to me so deeply John Myhre was very interested in Chicago and I remember we had a meeting in New York and he had all these wonderful ideas He saw Chicago kind of like a black and white Fred Astaire film And I said Well I see something very different And he said OK great What s that He was ready to throw it all out Immediately I thought Oh this is the guy for me He wants to serve the piece and help me discover it And he has exquisite taste and he s the hardest worker in the world and I can not imagine doing a film without him And then Colleen was probably the most established at that point she was already a three time Oscar nominee and won for Chicago I met her in Los Angeles and we had a drink at the Four Seasons She had never done a musical She was excited about that idea And she s just so inventive and so creative and I just liked her and I liked that she was passionate She still carries that passion She s such a brilliant artist and she sees things from a different angle always The one thing that is true of all three of them is they are collaborators and that s what I needed on my first film I needed to have people around me who were willing to collaborate not Hey this is how I am doing it or This is my style They were there for me And they still are almost years later Q What Beebe does in Into the Woods and Nine the backlighting the shafts of light the key lighting on faces all those things just really pop A I feel exactly the same way I think he paints with light And that s true of all the films Memoirs of a Geisha Chicago of course Nine and then Mary Poppins Returns is a whole other palette But he always finds that beauty And I try not to repeat a film stylistically Because these films take three sometimes four years of my life And so what you want is a very different experience a very different adventure And also when I hire somebody to work on something the most important thing is that I would like to have dinner with them I have to want to have dinner with them because you are living with them Q Does this creative kinship extend to your directing teams Your ADs your UPMs Are there people in that sphere whom you have worked with repeatedly A I have actually hopped around a little bit because I am shooting in Canada Los Angeles London But I have found in my last three films this wonderful AD whom I adore whose name is Ben Howarth and he s just the greatest And I have had wonderful ADs in my career But with him I found a kindred spirit It s so great when you find someone like that it makes making a film so much more delightful The experience of making a film is hard enough But I also want them to value their experience and for me that means making sure I value them I have had the luxury of having started as a choreographer And I watched film directors who worked in a very inclusive positive way And then others who did not I was working as a director on my first film and a director said to me Just remember everyone s here to serve you And as that director walked away I literally thought to myself It s the exact opposite I am there to serve everyone It s a very different way for me I do not want to be you know dictator We are all working together And I want to be there to bring out their greatest work It all feeds everything Q I know there s probably some heroes of yours who were not so kind I am thinking of somebody like Jerome Robbins who was a really tough taskmaster A I had an experience with Jerry which was interesting He was working on bringing Jerome Robbins Broadway to Broadway And there were a series of workshops that I was a part of And they were teaching us West Side Story High Button Shoes Fiddler on the Roof all of his material Then he would come in and ask us to dance it And we were dancing and I remember him stopping the room dead and said to me What are you doing And I said What you mean what am I doing He said Do not act Just do the steps And I was like Oh OK So I started to do it and he stopped again What are you doing And I said I do not even know how to dance without acting because what s so beautiful about your work is that everything means something Every move means something And that s actually how we were taught it too I said That s why you are so brilliant because you know how to bring acting to dance He was coming from the New York City Ballet And Broadway is different In Broadway you are playing a role and you are acting And so needless to say I did not get the job But he called me the next day and asked me if I would direct his tour of Fiddler on the Roof Q An even higher compliment A Yeah I did not do it because I did not really want to work with him for him But I recognized that he saw maybe something in me that was more of a director But as brilliant as he was I do not condone any of that kind of work I saw how he was with me and with other dancers belittling them That all comes from insecurity Most directors the reason they are angry or mean is because they are insecure about what they are doing You can not let that rule you You can not let the fear creep in Q I d like to talk a little bit about your development as an artist You had an interview at your alma mater Carnegie Mellon in And you rejected the notion of Pittsburgh as this steel town emphasizing that it had as much culture as any major metropolitan city in the country And you referred to it as a mini New York A For me it very much was I mean I was lucky that I had great parents who actually exposed us to so much of the arts there It s amazing when you think that Pittsburgh had its own ballet company its own opera company its own symphony its own summer stock which was the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera It had the Pittsburgh Public Theater and then some great theater colleges like Carnegie Mellon University like Point Park University And so we were surrounded by arts and the theater When I went to New York it felt like Oh this is familiar And I think it was helpful that I actually stayed and went to Carnegie Mellon University out of high school because I was able then to take advantage of all that was there It was the perfect place I had great mentors there And you are so close to New York too My whole family is from New England so we used to drive from Pittsburgh up to Boston and you know we d always stop in New York and that s when I would see shows The first Broadway show I ever saw I was years old I saw Angela Lansbury in Gypsy at the Winter Garden It was life changing Q Because you come from this theatrical academic background you do not have any experimental shorts or those grainy one act dramas one might expect from film school Is there some kind of avant garde work you did as a student that would point to the other side of Rob Marshall A You know it s funny Everyone asks So how did you become a film director I said it was the most unplanned trajectory because I really only saw my life in theater And it was others who saw that I had potential in film And when I was given the opportunity to for instance direct and choreograph Annie for television for The Wonderful World of Disney it was Craig Zadan and Neil Meron who saw that I had that potential And I had never been behind a camera And I purposely surrounded myself in that television film with theater people Q Yeah great cast A I had Victor Garber and Kristin Chenoweth and Alan Cumming and Kathy Bates who came from the theater as well and Audra McDonald So I had people around me with whom I could speak their same language and they spoke mine as I was trying to figure out how to do this And I will say that was the perfect way for me to enter into film through theater through a musical which I felt very confident with But how you film it and put it together that was all new But I will say and I know this is crazy but I realized when I was shooting Annie that I felt the most at home on a film set that I had ever felt I can just imagine what it is on film and then can do it So for whatever reason it was in my blood Q I have heard that Chita Rivera taught you a lot about discipline in the theater I am wondering how you applied that discipline to filmmaking A Well I will say that Chita is my hero and I was able to work with her at a very young age I was in a show called The Rink also with Liza Minnelli She was so incredible to work with The discipline and the joy of what she did was just infectious And I think you have to approach something with a great deal of respect which is what she does with theater and as a dancer The other thing that she told me was keep a sense of humor I mean I had it naturally anyway She is so funny and so fun and that s a big part of creating a company You spread that humor and sense of lightness and buoyancy to something so that when you are working you are working with friends and then you are all doing something together And so I think of her a lot She s very special to me Q You said once that as a dancer you had a bit of an advantage because you could also sing and act It seems to me there are a lot of actors today who forwent stage disciplines who never had to memorize a play whole or take dance classes so that their movement transcended their own body language How essential is stage training for actors and other craftspeople who work in film A Oh goodness I mean I think it s everything It s interesting the discipline of doing eight shows a week in the theater in addition to how you work and then bringing it to life every time like you have never done it before That is baked into me You have to do your homework and know what you are talking about You can not fake it I know there are directors out there who work in a sort of chaotic way and I could never do that You have to approach it with clarity because you are feeding this massive thing Otherwise it s like building a house of cards and one little card can knock out the whole thing Q One of the amusing things I heard you say in an interview was you discovered early on maybe in your television phase that the difference between theater and film was you can go from having to create a transition to just cutting It seems like the simplest thing in the world but it s one of those essential truths about the two mediums A It s so true One of the most complicated parts of working in theater is the transitions on stage moving from that scene to the next scene as the scenery comes lumbering on and you are moving into the next thing So you spend a majority of your time in the theater trying to figure out the set changes and how that works and keep it moving so that it s not falling apart When you are working on film you have all these wonderful tools so in a way sometimes it s limitless So I actually find myself putting limits on myself to try and say Well this is how I am going to tell the story here are the rules because there s so many ways to go But I will tell you coming from the theater it was freeing Q I remember attending a VFX panel here once and Michael Goi a cinematographer turned director said Just because you can do something does not mean you should A True You rarely need more just for the sake of more I always think about what is the core What is the center What is the story Anthony Minghella once said to me You know Rob we are hired for our taste And it s so simple but it s such a beautiful thing There are times and moments when it needs to be fireworks But then there are moments when it needs to be simple quiet and so you have to listen to your gut Nora Ephron said something that stuck with me for a long time She said Would not it be great if you could see your own movie And I thought Oh my God only another director would understand Because when you are editing a film you try to step back and see it fresh like you have never seen this film before But because you are so inside it you never really get that wonderful sort of vista I will say when you put a film you have made in front of an audience it s sort of the first time you actually start seeing the film because you start seeing it through their eyes Q You have worked with stage trained actors in movies and nonstage trained actors actors who were singing for the first time I am thinking about Daniel Day Lewis in Nine Ren e Zellweger in Chicago Chris Pine in Into the Woods I am sure there are plenty of other examples Tell me about how you are able to meld the two camps together and make them harmonious A The disciplines are different I remember working with Ren e Zellweger on Chicago and doing a scene where she fires Billy Flynn played by Richard Gere We had done a lot of rehearsal I had a sense of what to do with the blocking And so Ren e started doing it and was speaking very quietly And I said Well let us try and sort of get there And I remember Ren e said to me Let us not squeeze the lemons which I had no clue what she was talking about I was like pauses and then I realized Oh I see She s from film only She wants to have it in the moment and she does not want to pre plan And so that taught me a lot about working with actors who are from film and working with actors who are from theater I have never pushed my style on anybody because what I have realized is that everybody has their own process My goal is to make sure that each actor feels protected not judged and taken care of to be their best So I try and adapt for whatever people need So I have learned how to work with both And I love working with actors who are new to musicals I have two in Mermaid I have Javier Bardem and I have Melissa McCarthy And I love the discovery of that how they approach it the character you see them learning It was the same thrilling experience I had with Emily Blunt on Into the Woods She s such a natural musical performer but she wasn t fully aware of it They love discovering how their work as actors informs their work in the musical genre For me that s my favorite kind of musical performance one that comes first and foremost from character and story Because they realize that it s the same thing when they start to sing it s just an extension of what they are doing as actors It s not like they have to stop being an actor and then be a singer They are basically speaking on pitch They are communicating the same thing It all comes from the same place and so and there is nothing like it Meryl Streep said to me after we finished Into the Woods I only want to do musicals for the rest of my life Q One of the things that struck me about that movie was there were different types of acting styles Anna Kendrick s Cinderella was a very nuanced performance whereas Chris Pine s prince is very arch and almost campy And yet you somehow made it all work together A All these fairytales were sort of intersecting And what s great about that is that then you have so many different kinds of styles So you have these pompous princes played by Chris Pine and Billy Magnussen who are artificial and were raised to be charming not sincere I do not really like stylization where you do not feel for people I want to feel them emotionally I want to be connected to them and follow their story I always look for the truth even some thing that s sort of bigger it s filled with truth If it s not filled with truth it s like a two dimensional cutout and you never feel connected When I see a film I want to be moved I want to feel Q Memoirs of a Geisha exhibits a different style than your musicals both in tone and acting A It was a very conscious choice to do Geisha after Chicago I had this wonderful opportunity at that moment Your film has won an Oscar for best film so you are in a place where you kind of can have some choice and I really wanted a completely different experience And I am a huge fan of David Lean s work and to be able to create an epic grand landscape with this intimate tale was something that really intrigued me And because I was working with all of these Asian actors who were new to English cinema I was working with interpreters the entire time to speak with either the Japanese actors or to the Chinese actors who were speaking English for the first time Q Gong Li s performance in particular was transfixing A She is breathtaking She is so tall so otherworldly And then she is such a divine actor and can pull from the deepest places I remember there s scene where she is burning down their house their okiya And I remember we were working on that in the morning and then we took lunch and she never left the stage Sat on that set through lunch until everybody was back so that she would be in the same emotion place She did not move at all It s astounding to see the dedication that she has as an actor and how much it meant to her She was very much like Daniel Day Lewis in that way Q Now there was a bit of a press about the casting of Chinese actors for the female leads in that movie A I think one of the most beautiful things about being an actor is being able to play different things different kinds of people And if it was that strict to have to be the person you are playing then the acting profession becomes so limiting And you know I appreciate authenticity and I think maybe there are times when I feel that needs to be the case But we are creating a fiction on that screen not a documentary I remember when we were casting Ziyi Zhang to play the geisha role we saw a lot of Japanese actors We saw Chinese actors We saw Korean actors My choice was to do a pan Asian cast And who is the actor that makes me believe that Nobody I was auditioning was a geisha And the great thing about Ziyi is not only her work as an actor but also she s a dancer and an athlete She was able to do what a geisha can do head and shoulders above anybody else who came Who is going to make me believe and see that character come to life That s all I care about and that s what I look for Neil Simon once said to me that the hope is an actor comes in and claims the role There s no choice Q Another collaborator that you worked with repeatedly is the casting director Francine Maisler A I met her on Memoirs of a Geisha which was one of the most complicated casting sessions that you can imagine And she thinks out of the box She has that eye She s looking for that something special And what people do not realize about casting directors is they basically present people to you You are still choosing them casting it yourself But there s a filter and they are looking for that person like you are hunting for who that can be especially when you are doing a musical I mean I felt like when I was doing Chicago and no one was doing musicals certainly especially live action musicals it was very difficult to find actors who sang and danced So we were doing basically detective work finding who sang in high school who was a cheerleader Ren e Zellweger was a cheerleader And Catherine Zeta Jones played on the West End Q Talking about thinking out of the box your Ariel in Little Mermaid is not an actor that a lot of people would have imagined especially based on the original Disney animated version of this story A It was one of the easiest decisions I have ever made because she did exactly what I just described which is she came in and claimed the role You know when you are looking for a character you are looking for those character traits that are sometimes indescribable And Ariel needs to have a sort of wide eyed wonder about the world plus a fiery spirit plus an angelic voice plus something otherworldly because she s not from this world And she s experiencing something for the first time You know there are so many jaded actors out there trying to play that But to play something with that kind of authenticity and that kind of special magic that s what Halle Bailey had immediately and no one else had that I am always interested in color blind casting and just looking at all the great people But I am looking for the person I am not looking for the person who fits into the mold of how we are going to present this For me it s looking for that internal thing that brings the character to life and then you see the film comes to life in front of you And that happened with Halle Q I d like to end this by touching upon something you referenced earlier the healing power of art Meryl Streep said that she took the role in your Mary Poppins movie because she felt that story was what the world needed at that time A When you see the dangerous and fragile world we are living in it s so important to look for beauty look for something that lifts you out of your daily life because it s so hard So where can you turn for that inspiration for something to uplift you to inspire you to give you something to live for I find that in art I find it in film I find it in theater I find it in music I find it in painting And I have been increasingly aware of how important movies are that can take you somewhere else and give you an experience that s emotional and hopeful There s a lot of dark movies out there these days and I find myself wanting to do the opposite with storytelling that s about building bridges between our worlds It s the one place we can all turn to to remember that there s beauty and magic in the world
4340,4340,"[quote=SXRDISBEST;59070200]Thanks for all that info! It seems like a pretty significant upgrade. I feel that the change in the bulb assembly in the newer generation jvcs is a major step up. I think the RS45 was the last of the older style. The lack of a complete cms is a major weakness of the 45 as well. I have mine dialed in fairly well and luckily I'm not that ocd about the picture so it doesn't bother me at all. I thinky next upgrade will be on a laser driven unit. But definitely not the dlp that they're selling now. I'm just not a dlp fan at all unless they're 3 chip. [/quote] The color and gamma is pretty good on the RS-45 when you get it dialed in, no argument there. The problem is how long it takes to get it dialed in, especially if you lose a lot of brightness and suddenly need a different gamma to compensate. The big difference is the OOTB color. I'm not a purist when it comes to color, the way I calibrate my projectors is I do about 3-5 calibrations and put them in the SAVED slots. Then I just compare the nuances in color and keep the one I like better. I often find myself choosing a slightly cooler color around 7000k instead of 6500k, though that is not necessarily because of the color temp (maybe a tiny bit), but could just be because of the way the error stacked in my specific calibration. I rarely choose the one with the smallest DE, you don't want that clinical look (too cool) or that super warm look (yellow or red faces), but you want it between. Director's intent or not, because I think some of the movies are too warm when it comes to skin tones. The color is just very exceptional on these newer models, bordering on amazing really.

1588,1588,kofidog said I was looking for something with a strong narcotic couch lock effect to use for making RSO cannabis oil When I first started making RSO i was always looking for pure indica strains but over time I learned that the amount of indica to sativa should correspond to when you take it a pure indica is great an hour before bed and a pure sativa is great when you first wake up or relatively early in the day a hybrid is great at about PM or so depending on when you want to go to sleep all the indica dominant hybrids make wonderful oils but the heavier they are towards the indica side the later you want to take them because once the sativa effects stop and the indica effects start it s a challenge to stay awake I can not quantify this with any sort of science but from my experience the sativa effects always seem to start first so the more sativa there is the longer the energetic effects last If it s an oil from a pure sativa or anything above like sativa pop it in the morning your day will be amazing unless you dose too hard and trip balls at work YMMV start small I paint houses for a living and a pure sativa rso pill in the morning is outstanding keeps me going and happy all day use a happy strain like jack herrer or mandarin haze then when you get home pop a or wait a couple hours if you made a heavier indica oil and pop it later on maybe before or after eating either way is about the same as In the end each oil is a little different but they are all great and they all have an accumulative effect on muscle tension and general mood which is usually positive unless you make oil from weed that was picked too late that stuff is a little too paranoid for me I stick to the happy strains whenever i can and pick as soon as amber trichs show up and the rest are cloudy Of course if you are treating something this might be pointless but I just like people to know that there are multiple ways to use this oil and it is fantastic CBD RSO is also great Cheers

2383,2383,"Selling a 16-month old pure Northern blue-tongue skink. (Tiliqua scincoides intermedia) Hand tamed and very comfortable around people. Never tries to bite and will make a great pet as well as a breeder. I have the parents too if you want to see photos of them. This one was a holdback but I am short of space now as I am putting together a colony of Merauke BTs as well. He is about 20 inches long, close to adult size but he will continue to fill out, and grow larger for the next few years. Super healthy and has never had any health issues or injuries. He is a great eater and will eat anything from high quality canned dog food, scrambled eggs, snails, bits of chicken and salmon, thawed mice (he likes them about ) and rat pinks, super worms, and occasionally fruits such as blueberries, apples, etc. Probably a boy (based on body shape and head) but no guarantee. Could be a girl. I have not seen a sperm plug or introduced ""him"" to other adult Northern BTs. If you are not familiar with them, Northern blue-tongues are super hardy, become very tame with handling, and grow to nearly 2 ft. in length. One of the best reptile pets -- an ideal choice for beginners. They can live over 20 years. $395 plus FedEx overnight shipping. Free pickup in Tucson, Arizona. It is getting cold in many areas of the country, and I will not ship if it might endanger the safety of the skink. Please keep that in mind if you are already in the winter deep freeze. Please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you. You can email me directly at: devildingokilim@"
7650,7650,Interesting but you missed the point The argument does not depend on the English word for the cloths but upon the use of the spices The spices had no effect on the shroud And my other question is there an image on the sudarium A jawbone maybe There is a claim that it still exists Yes it still exists or at least what purports to be the Sudarium still exists and it has a provenance back the th Century It has a semi face print on it and a distinguishable bloody hand print under computer enhancement as well as approximately points of congruence with the blood stains on the Shroud of Turin Both the Shroud and the Sudarium test to the same blood type Diagonal fold stains in the blood show signs of being rolled into a kerchief format to be used exactly as I described and has the size and length appropriate for both usages It also shows patterns of being draped over a head while upright and bloody puncture wounds were it may have been caught on a cap like crown of thorns Perhaps on the Cross before the body being taken down then while lying supine then again while being carried face down The fingers of the hand print can be discerned under computer enhancement and covers the area where face would be while supporting the head while being carried face down perhaps to the tomb Many people are completely convinced the face cloth is a napkin or a handkerchief sized piece of cloth They picture something that they would use today for those purposes It was not and is not The cloth was a SWEAT CLOTH It had a specific use in the period Neither of those purposes as translated as napkin or handkerchief defines it although a large bandana as some people might use one today might get close A non elastic sweatband or a doo rag that one could tie around one s head would be a better definition Something to wrap around one s head to keep wet hair and sweat out of one s eyes in a hot working environment something one can drag off of the head and wipe one s face with i e a SWEAT CLOTH a towel like one might use while playing tennis The size is good sized Here is the Sudarium of Oviedo the one thought to have been used to cover Jesus after he died on the Cross before he was taken down then used while being carried and then pressed into service again to tie his jaw closed The Sudarium of Oviedo Linen one over one weave dimensions ~ by ~ by ~ diagonal The amount of TIME from approximately the NINTH hour when Jesus is thought to have succumbed until sundown the start of the Sabbath is insufficient to go to Pilate plead the case for being given the body have his death checked buy the hundred weight of spices and ointments the fine Syndon taking Him down off the cross taking His body to the tomb doing even minimal preparations and then going and getting ritually cleansed BEFORE the beginning of Sabbath with officially starts AT SUNDOWN No work including washing burials etc can be done on the Sabbath NONE People would be stoned for even being on the streets for anything except going to Temple Many considered Sabbath to start anytime during Eret Sabeth i e AFTERNOON of the day before Sabbath That was the time of preparation Only those things preparing for Sabbath could be done then NOT OPTIONAL If Jesus died at PM Sundown is approximately PM That gives a window of hours to do everything necessary to bury Jesus Ninth Hour PM It is finished Jesus Dies Witnesses are in shock It takes some time to realize He is actually dead so quickly PM Realizing that Jesus is actually dead Joseph of Arimathea approaches the family and disciples and offers his unused tomb and offers to pay to bury Jesus After a discussion they agree and approach the Centurion to request Jesus body be taken down from the Cross for burial PM Centurion tells Joseph he must have a permit from Pilate for release of the body It is almost a half mile to the Praetorium Antonia where Pilate is holding office Joseph sets of quickly to plead for Jesus body but he is not young and since it is Passover the city is filled with many people there to make sacrifices at the temple which is right next to the Antonia PM Joseph arrives at the Antonia and asks to see Pilate Assume it took an hour or so for Nicodemus and Joseph to get through the Roman bureaucracy to get permission from Pilate who would need assurances that Jesus was truly dead for release of His body PM Joseph and Nicodemus with permit finally in hand head back toward Golgotha shopping along the way for burial spices and ointments Joseph also purchases a Syndon a large fine Linen cloth and other grave cloths and toting about pounds whether this is in actual weight or value is actually unsaid PM Joseph and Nicodemus arrive back at Golgotha with their purchases permit and presumably some assistants carrying the spices and ointments and show the permit to the Centurian and his four soldiers still guarding the bodies on the crucifixes They proceed to the task of getting Jesus body down off the Cross pulling the nails from hands feet etc PM The Centurion and Soldiers release Jesus body to the family Joseph and Nicodemus who then have to carry the body and all the supplies to the tomb Sabbath is impending and all of them have their own cleansing still to do before sundown at PM PM The group arrives with the body at the tomb lay the Shroud on the stone niche put the body on it quickly bind the arms legs grab the Sudarium that had covered Jesus head roll it into a rope like kerchief and tie it under his beard around his head up over the crown of his head and tie it Someone reaches into his purse and produces a couple of coins to place on the eyes as weights to keep the eyes closed not having any convenient potsherds The quickly pack everything else the spices the ointments etc around the body and pull the rest of the shroud over the head and down to the feet PM The group has just a half hour to get home cleans themselves both literally of the blood and also ritually before the beginning of the Sabbath It is unlikely they ve been able to do any of the normal preparations for the next day so likely unless another family member did them for them they will not eat not have any lamps lit not have water jugs filled etc They were too busy with Jesus death and getting him buried before sundown as required even if not completed to do what was necessary for their own preparation for their day of no work Where in that short timeline did they have any time to do a proper embalming the word literally means to properly place oils or balm or anoint a body I can t find it Ask yourself one simple question WHY were the women going to the tomb on Sunday morning The Gospels tell us it was because the burial had been hurried and incomplete on Friday and they were going to COMPLETE the washing and anointing the tasks that had not been finished before Sabbath started Had Jesus been fully cocooned as this argument holds there d be no way they could have done anything It does not make any sense None at all There is ZERO evidence for it except for some guy s pipe dream Also as I said above we ve excavated st Century Jewish burials with shrouds wrapped over and under bodies and they are not cocoons Here s one from the same stone tomb where another crucifixion victim Jehonannan son of Ezekiel a man with a nail through his ankles was buried Amazing this body was covered with a draped over the head doubled shroud bound at ankles and wrists and had a binding around the head to keep the jaw closed not a second cloth to cover the face WOW Note it follows the Mishnah s Jewish burial customs Not some assumptions of people thousands of miles away who have no idea what they are talking about based on about SIX LINES in just four reports referring to according to the customs of Jews to bury their dead as if the reader would be familiar with those customers as translated from ancient Greek words written to years post events about people who originally spoke Hebrew and Aramaic not Greek doing the translations fifteen hundred years later applying a contemporary mis understanding by conflating customs from another culture s burial practices from rumors they heard of bodies uncovered in an area that just happened to be somewhere in the general direction of the Holy Land All of this misapprehension because people assume that words mean today what they meant years ago and also meant years ago what they meant years ago FACT They often did not Or the nuances of day to day usage meant something different to those who spoke them THAT is what has to be teased out

483,483,It s been a month of us all being and working from home and what have we been doing in that time The same thing we do every day Pinky try and survive the COVID quarantine Making Easter Eggs always helps in riding out a quarantine But in all seriousness it s hard to write this post given everything that happening all around us right now and it sounds a bit wrong to say this in such a scary time Adam s note and it IS scary The more I read the news the higher my anxiety level rises This is the first actual threat to our American way of life that I have ever encountered in my lifetime Who knows how long this will last or what the repercussions will be for our economy and country but all in all we are having the time of our lives here during the COVID quarantine It feels like we are in our own little protective bubble here on our little half acre of sunny Virginia But there s still quite a bit of cognitive dissonance in that though because even though I know it s tough for a lot of families in a lot of ways right now we are skating through this pretty insulated from most of the ill effects Our family loves being all at home together we have enough food and supplies and our paycheck is secure and I can work remotely It does feel very much like a pivot point in modern history though What will we look like as a country and society on the other end of this We shall see But enough of the doom and gloom Read on for How We Live COVID Quarantine Edition Zero chance COVID survives a stand off with this hair We are on week Adam s note or or honestly at this point if feels like groundhog day every day of the quarantine and for all we have been shut down we have actually kept pretty busy The first salvo of closings to hit us was school shutting down for three weeks That s a long time so Karen immediately jumped into action fulfilling a lifelong dream to homeschool our kids While that effort had it s ups and downs those weeks turned out to be much better than when the Fairfax County School District got their act together and started offering distance learning Karen s note though the FCPS effort has been pretty underwhelming so far But through all of that the kids seems to be doing well and even enjoying the explosion of screen time with all the homework apps and such they are into now It s not the same as normal school of course but our kids are doing great We have kept up piano and violin lessons via Skype too Watching General Conference with popcorn One of the things that was a pretty stark contrast right away for us in all of this was the lack of all evening commitments as pretty much everything has been shut down as we have been ordered to stay at home and do social distancing No church no dance lessons no sports practices no nothing It s just been us being together and learning to help around the house a lot more Our baseball season is on the verge of being cancelled too Which is truly a bummer as I was all set to be Benjamin s single A coach this year along with one of my good friends out here We managed to get one practice in before the virus hit and shut everything down We were also able to get one session in the batting cages after that before the county changed the locks on the cages Adam s note c mon now So we have taken our bucket of baseballs to the local elementary school backstops and just kept right on plugging away Adam s note take that coronavirus Happy Karen with her kids and puzzles all around her on quiet Sunday afternoon One good thing we also realized one of Karen s lifelong dreams during quarantine by having some good old fashioned family jigsaw puzzle time Karen s note it only took years And we have also seen a dramatic uptick in the amount of board games going on at ECT Headquarters advancing one of Adam s lifelong dreams Adam s note Karen even played Scrabble with me one night Other than that Sarah has really gotten good at cooking Sarah s note especially cookies and other treats and helping to hid easter eggs and Karen just cleaned out an extra bedrooms worth of fabric and craft stuff We have also had dinner on the deck a few times and the kids have taken advantage of the nice weather by doing outdoor lunches too We have taken to our bikes out a lot this past few weeks exploring the trails around our house and in breaking news Emily is now a fully fledged adventure biker She completed her first big bike rides around Lake Mercer AND all the way around Burke Lake during these past couple of weeks One of these past weekends we also went to the nearby site of the First and Second Battle of Manasses or the Battle of Bull Run for all you yankees to see the bluebell blossoms an annual tradition that Karen keeps to remember her brother Eric But one of the biggest stars of ECT Quarantine has definitely been our trusty old trampoline We have gotten more use out of that thing in the past month than ever before And it s a joy to see all five Tracy kids out there having fun together The kids are out there pretty much every day begging for Daddy to come jump with them Tracy kids note bounce us Daddy Do bum busters Daddy I am sure all the neighbors think we are destroying social distancing rules by having a neighborhood block party in our backyard every day Hopefully they know by now that all those kids are ours Take that social distancing Laura and Daddy on the trail in Manasses We have also been following the guidance of the prophet President Nelson and having church at home This has been a pretty cool experience We get the children together and dressed in Sunday clothes and have a short sacrament meeting in the living room followed by the trip to the family room where we have a fun Primary type lesson We face the same difficulties in reverence that we do on normal Sundays but it s getting better every week And Ryan and Sarah have played prelude music on the piano and all the kids have been involved in prayers and songs and such Sarah playing prelude music for our home church service And we have definitely been missing time with friends after a month of this both for Karen and I and the kids One of Benjamin s friends stopped by with his dad the other day just to say hello They were bored and only live a couple of blocks over so came by to see if we were bored too Well the kids were stunned and replied that they were in no way bored because they had the trampoline Legos the stream going on bike rides and kept going on until it was a little embarrassing Not the response his friend had expected So in short

1088,1088,Celes s attack was very impressive to say the least and the pluses that had been wailing and sobbing seemed to calm slightly as the mysterious feudal warrior appeared and quickly dispatched the hollow that was closest to them already some of the further off Pluses attempted to start heading toward Celes those that were not chained to anything that is It soon was apparent that they would be relying on Celes to be a rallying point for their safety OF course the hollows that moved in were promptly SMOOSHED The air suddenly seeming to QUAKE as the hollows infront of Celes suddenly just were CRUNCHED as if flattened by some invisible force Though Celes would barely be able to make out the outline of something MASSIVE Some huge creature And just below that hulking thing seemed to be a hollow Eyes glowing yellow as a ong naga like old man slithered toward her hunched forward but still monster like with long drooping white hair and a mask like some japanese play Slithering forth as the barely visible beast stomped forward as well Those eyes fixated on the shinigami and a soft low wheezing Heeeeheeheeheehee Well well Another whipper snapper to teach a lesson to The hollow would rasp holding it s hands behind it s back like some old martial artists getting ready to spar with one of his pupils Only Celes would see that mass shift suddenly something opening up The only warning she d get was the air suddenly being sucked toward the hollow the force whistling around her Just before She likely would not even hear the actual roar As that suddenl explosive wave of sound would hit her with tremendous force possibly even knocking her down as the sound would immediately attempt to burst her eardrums so that rather than the roar itself just a sudden loud high pitched keen of her hearing being blown out an attack designed to eliminate her sense of balance by popping her inner ears The pluses around her would fall to the ground alive but silently crying out as they clutched their heads As a long centipede like hollow would begin crawling in from the other side attempting to snatch some of the pluses while Celes was distracted Mizu herself was having more trouble than she d expected as well The first hollow had been easy as pie to deal with But this was Karakura Not only were hollows plentiful But they were strong Three aerial hollows already were closing in on her One of which was some sort of Winged bird Another was a long eastern dragon type thing And of course a third was some sort of Insect All closing in after they had seen her take down the weaker hollow from before Now that the shinigami had shown up MANY of the weaker hollow seemed to just bounce As if coordinated the fodder just got the hell out of there instead seeking to pick off the pluses out in the outskirts and let their stronger bretheren deal with the shinigami themselves as they tried to pick up scraps Highly unusual behavior for just normal fodder Which made it clear that this was some sort of group With those bigger stronger hollows taking up a sort of leadership role Orina actually recognized some of it Whenever she had her brief journeys to Hueco Mundo she often found it convenient to force some of the weaker hollows to do as she said Tch The first hollow that charged in was that dragon It s body weaving and warping as it moved toward her racing in with it s mouth wide For just a moment that maw opened a Cero charging nothing too difficult And Orina raized Shinkai ready to deal with it However out of the side of her vision her sharp ES caught something else A ripple One she knew VERY well Ulcera She darted her eyes over in time to see that fucking bird vanish into thin air pushing into some unseen door FUCK She crouched getting ready making as if she was going to block that cero Head on And at the very last moment she blurred her body zipping up into the air as that cero roared past where she was a moment before and as she did that Bird suddenly spilled out of the Ulcera a hail of feathers peppering down around the spot as well A startled squawk escaping it as it seemed surprised that she had noticed the tactic they had been employing This was a problem If they were coordinating then it would be way too easy for them to overwhelm her And so she twisted her trident spinning it through her fingers After that there was a loud WHOOSH as water outright EXPLODED Up in the air even from where celes was she would see an absolute EXPLOSION of water bursting outward from the Acting Captain as suddenly the water suddenly filled out stopping just shy of the air above Celes s head That water stopping and twisting around filling a massive meter wide sphere in the sky completely encapsuling the three hollows in that huge massive ball of almost black water Deep green water you might expect on stormy seas Completely hiding those inside Though Celes could still see a bit of the water on the outside able to see maybe about meters in Of course on the inside Orina was just as blind but well the difference being that she was able to sense and FEEL the location of everything inside of that Sphere of water The three hollows suddenly panicking holding their breath unaware that they could actually breathe in this sphere of water Of course Orina knew this She twisted floating in the water as she slashed with her trident A blade of water suddenly LANCING out streaking through the depths The Phoenix bird that had been firing feathers at her would not even be able to see the thin current in the water lancing toward her shearing clean through the hollow s body severing one of it s wings and making it shriek out the noise completely smothered by the water anyway other than a low frequency blubbing Just as Orina lanced in from her old position streaking in through the darkness and slamming her Trident into the hollow s spine bursting in and stabbing clean through There was a sudden mix of red in the water piercing clean through the hollow s body through it s middle as the thing thrashed just a little Before she whispered softly only allowing the hollow to hear her Bankai There was a MUCH bigger explosion of reiatsu What FELT like a Class reiatsu almost as she unleashed her Bankai Her trident dissolving into bubbles as something much more dangerous SLAMMED into the bird from above feet long it opened it s mouth and CHOMPED the Hollow whipping it s head about and CHOMPING clean through it s body swallowing it as the beast was promptly mutilated The remains of the bird thrashed around Now missing one half ot it s body IT opened it s beak a defiant cero forming in it s mouth as it attempted to fire where the beast had been a moment before Not that it would be there Both the beast and Orina could sense that Cero The big whale vanished into thin air slipping into an ulcera as that cero roared out Celes down below would see that beam shooting out of that globe of water foring off into the air even slicing a VERY unlucky flying hollow in half Inside the water that leviathan of a bankai simply spilled back into reality just beside the hollow Mouth agape and CHOMPING down on the hollow s head Finally finishing it off as those wings beat against it s face trying to slice it up but failing against the thick armor that the leviathan was afforded Her Bankai promptly ripping chewing and then swallowing the hollow whole As in her mind Orina could sense that the other two flying hollows had bumped into eachother The Dragon and the insect seeming to now be sticking together swimming around trying to find the edge of the

8878,8878,Abstract Background Mesenchymal stem cells MSCs have great potential for the repair and regeneration of bone fracture but their optimal origins remain controversial Methods Bone marrow MSCs BM MSCs and bone bone marrow MSCs B BM MSCs were isolated from SD rats and the morphology MSC associated markers and proliferative capacity of these cells were compared using an inverted microscope flow cytometry and CCK assays respectively After days of osteoblastic induction osteoblast phenotypes were detected by ALP and calcium nodule staining and the expression of BMP and TGF Œ≤1 was observed by western blotting Then the rat tibia fracture model was established with groups n = per group the control BM MSC and B BM MSC groups Computed tomography CT imaging was performed to evaluate fracture healing at weeks and Finally the fractured bones were removed at weeks and and HE staining was performed to evaluate fracture healing Results Although the types of MSCs shared the same cellular morphology and MSC associated markers B BM MSCs had a higher proliferative rate than BM MSCs from day to day p < and the expression levels of ALP and calcium were obviously higher in B BM MSCs than in BM MSCs after osteogenic induction p < and p < respectively Western blot results showed that the expression levels of BMP and TGF Œ≤1 in B BM MSCs were higher than in BM MSCs before and after osteogenic induction p < In the animal experiments CT imaging and gross observation showed that B BM MSCs had a greater capacity than BM MSCs to promote fracture healing as the Lane Sandhu scores of B BM MSCs at weeks and after operation ¬± and ¬± respectively were higher than those of BM MSCs ¬± and ¬± respectively both p < The HE staining results further supported this conclusion Conclusions Taken together our study results proved that MSCs obtained by co culturing the bone and bone marrow from SD rats had better proliferative osteogenic differentiation and fracture healing capacities than BM MSCs perhaps suggesting a novel way to obtain MSCs for bone tissue repair Introduction Fracture is a common surgical complication that is expensive to treat and has negative effects on individuals and society In addition approximately of fractures cannot be cured in a normal way Orthopedists have adopted many solutions to promote the regeneration of bone tissues among which stem cell therapy plays an important role Mesenchymal stem cells MSCs are a type of adult stem cell that can develop into cells of bone adipose cartilage tendon ligament et cetera MSCs are used as seed cells in tissue engineering transplantation because of their high proliferative capacity multidirectional differentiation potential low immunogenicity and paracrine effects At present the available sources of MSCs are the umbilical cords bone marrow dental pulp bone adipose et cetera However there are currently no excellent methods for obtaining MSCs for fracture treatment have been found yet For example it is difficult to apply umbilical cord MSCs in clinical practice due to limited sources For MSCs derived from the bone marrow BM MSCs the bone marrow has a small number of MSCs and their osteogenic potential is weaker than that of bone MSCs B MSCs Similarly adipose derived MSCs have worse osteogenic potential than B MSCs Although B MSCs can be used as important seed cells for promoting bone regeneration large amounts of the bone isolated from the body would cause serious secondary damage severely limiting its clinical application Other approaches to MSC acquisition also face challenges in sourcing tumorigenicity control osteogenic potential et cetera Therefore it is necessary to develop a new approach to extract MSCs with great proliferative capacity and osteogenic potential from various sources while causing minimal damage to the body Studies have shown that co culture of cartilage and MSCs can improve the chondrogenic ability of MSCs and the stimulation of MSCs with fibroblast growth factor can enhance their ability to promote fracture repair of MSCs These results suggest that MSCs interact with the environment in ways that affect their growth Meanwhile the bone and bone marrow co exist in biological organisms and MSCs in co cultures of the bone and bone marrow are more similar to endogenous cells In this study we developed a novel way to obtain MSCs by co culturing the bone and bone marrow B BM MSCs and explored whether the acquired MSCs are more effective at healing bone tissues To address this problem types of MSCs were isolated from the bone marrow and from co cultures of the bone and bone marrow and the cellular characteristics and capacity for fracture healing of the types of cells were compared Since TGF Œ≤1 and BMP play important regulatory roles in the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells we examined the expression of TGF Œ≤1 and BMP before and after osteogenic induction in both groups and further explored the relevant mechanisms Materials and methods Isolation and culture of rat B BM MSCs and BM MSCs A week old male SD rat was sacrificed with an injection of chloral hydrate and the femur and tibia were

but she d never wanted to punch someone as much as their current Vice Captain Flora The cocky female had gotten on Rosalia s nerves which was an achievement in itself considering the older model was generally pretty chill badum tss with everything She d rubbed her the wrong way the moment she opened her mouth tried to force her beliefs of witch culture onto her and then had dissed her mother The air around her dropped significantly again at the memory and she felt the ice underneath her shatter Rosalia had never met her parents She was raised by three idiot witch thieves who had decided to call themselves her brothers If she had to call that childhood abuse family ever again she d rather have Malcolm or Zaven kill her on the spot The Magic Knights was the closest thing she had to a family The Black Bulls were a change of pace that she much needed after meeting Flora in the Blue Roses Plus she was getting a lot of judgment for bringing so many men into her room anyways Nobody cared who left her room in the morning in Sosshi Standing up the red head pulled the headband off of her crimson hair letting it fall lose over her shoulders Some of her ends were wet due to the ice she d summoned while training but she didn t mind it The cold had stopped bothering her the moment she was chosen by her new grimoire at the Witch s Forest It was a benefit of the Ice affinity that she didn t expect but welcomed silently The woman decided to head back into town satisfied with the amount of progress she d made in trying to craft new spells She still had to practice her techniques on shielding allies but that would come with time Her mana was drained and she knew she d feel her muscles aching tomorrow morning Walking past the small Sosshi bookstore the red head stopped and picked out a few books she was interested in reading paid the friendly old lady who she d grown accustomed to and debated on heading back to the Black Bulls base Her heeled black combat boots clicked against the gravel of the town s streets as she debated on what to do next with her free time until her eyes shot open She stopped in the middle of the road The hairs on the back of her neck stood on end as she spun around to face the familiar Naughty Nymph tavern and her gaze narrowed What the fuck Rosalia wasn t drunk yet but she was certain her mind was playing tricks on her A familiar mana signature had entered her small but focused range of senses One she thought belonged to someone gone forever or dead It couldn t be could it A snippet of her younger years living with a particularly short and sweet Azure Deer ran through her head and Rosalia felt as if someone had just splashed her with bucket of water There was no way No way that Isabelle Erebus her best friend pre magic knight exams was just sitting in a tavern in the very town she was currently based in She looked around for a rogue mage fully expecting someone to be playing tricks on her That or she still had a shitton of alcohol left in her bloodstream from yesterday The ice wizardess rubbed her temples for a few seconds before finally deciding to go check Worst case scenario she was disappointed once more at her inability to find her old friend She d given up hope three months ago anyways Pushing the wooden door open Rosalia stepped into the bar immediately spotting the owner of the magical signature and nearly dropping her books in the process That long purple hair Her heels clicked over rapidly to where the frame of an adult Isabella was sitting She sat across from her placing her books gently on the table as she scanned the face of the woman in front of her She had no words Was she real I don t know if I m still drunk from yesterday or going crazy Rosalia would laugh as she turned to the bartender motioning for a pint of whatever before turning back to the noble but if you re who I think you are I propose we get smashed while you tell me where the hell you ve been and why I couldn t find you for months She d give Isabella a wolfish grin her tone of voice a booming mix of disbelief and hope WC

10006,10006,Saturday Night Live decided that it was time to try defying gravity and premiered its th season with an impressive technical feat During Billie Eilish s debut SNL performance of her hit song Bad Guy the teenage wunderkind added actual wall climbing to her list of achievements as she appeared to walk on the sides and ceiling of the stage It was a dizzying number to watch and several fans were understandably confounded by how Eilish s stunt was executed which she performed while wearing a medical boot no less The year old singer performed two songs from her album When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go And while her rendition of Bad Guy was the most mind boggling Eilish also sang I Love You with her brother and artistic collaborator Finneas O Connell The second performance was much more low key with the two sitting in chairs and wearing matching outfits while O Connell played the guitar Although most viewers were confounded by how exactly Eilish was able to walk on walls during Bad Guy that just made it even more entertaining to watch That was one of the top original SNL performances of all time scyber commented under an NBC show s tweet Another fan begged her to do this same effect on her just announced world tour Saturday Night Live on YouTube While SNL did not explain how exactly they achieved this effect during Bad Guy the camera zoomed out twice during her performance so audiences could see the stage she was standing on The singer s musical accompaniment was located below her and the square stage that Eilish was in likely rotated so that the walls became the floor and so on As that mn kid pointed out in the SNL subreddit the NBC sketch show has done something similar to Eilish s performance before Back in comedic magicians Penn and Teller performed a magic trick on the show and only at the end when the cameras zoomed out did audiences learn that the two men had been hanging upside down the whole time Still other fans drew references to other pieces of pop culture namely Lionel Richie s music video Dancing on the Ceiling which had a similar effect to the ones used in Eilish s live performance Another thought it may be an homage to the scene in A Space Odyssey where one of the astronauts is jogging around the circular spaceship But while the pop singer s performance was technically impressive some viewers were clearly either unfamiliar with Eilish s music or were not fans of her unique style Indeed the young singer is certainly avant garde especially for SNL and it s clear that not everyone vibed with her out there sensibilities But while audiences may have been divided on Eilish s songs there s no denying that her performance was both brave and remarkable Hopefully she s not dizzy now from all of that gravity defying singing and has her feet planted firmly on the ground now that her SNL performance is over Eilish has certainly set a high bar for future musical guests your move Taylor Swift

5851,5851,AN UNBELIEVABLE CONVERSATION It s been quite a while since I shared any rants but a recent Zoom conversation I had was just unbelievable I called in to some friends halfway across the world I will not mention the country but you can probably guess which one just by the description of the conversation I had to highlight a portion of the conversation specifically in reference to one of them because it was nothing less than a complete disbelief For anonymity s sake let us refer to said friend as Bob ~halfway through the conversation Bob How is the situation in your country You all staying at home Me Yeah we are Been more than a month since we were in lockdown On the bright side the number of infections is on the decline and hopefully in another few weeks we d have it under control Bob A month And all the businesses are close Me Aside the essentials yeah As you can see from my hair it s been a while since I went to the barber s Bob And you all just take it You all never felt that it was an oppression of your basic human rights The right to freedom The right to get food The right not to be told when you have to turn out the lights Hell I mean if I wanted to get a god damned haircut it s my god damned right to get it Me wtf look on the face Well it s tough when you are confined in your homes but it s not like you are not allowed to get basic necessities It s more of a restriction on social gatherings That way the government and frontliners will be able to contain the spread better Since many of us are not medical staff the least we can do is not add to their plate by staying home Bob Dear God you all need to stand up to your government They are lying to you It s not that serious if you keep your distance This is the problem with you all third world people You all just sit down and take the bullshit your government serves you Well I say to hell with it We ain t sitting down any longer Me The heck are you saying Bob I am saying over here we are not taking this any longer People are unemployed our rights are being trampled on We are telling the governor that enough is enough Ain t it Braveheart that said You may take our lives but you may never take our freedom no idea what this has to do with anything So I am telling you the proud people of my state will not sit quietly and let these damned liberals take a shit on my rights Me Bob you are missing the point here This is a virus which the world has never faced before It is an unprecedented pandemic that has no known or verifiable cure We are just doing what we can to hopefully save the human race We know for one that this virus transmission is effective through contact So isolation is the safest way in containing it Bob Awww that s just government mumbo jumbo That is the kind of nonsense that the communist backed WOO he meant WHO is feeding you people and you all simple folk are just eating it up I am telling you they are killing your rights Me Ok Bob Let me put it this way if the governor reopens the state and allows for free movement because a lockdown is an infringement of your rights then what will you do if there is a spike in cases Not to gloat on a pandemic but your country has an absolutely insane number of coronavirus cases I shit you not this was exactly what he said after that Bob You have just proven my point Thomas not sure what point but ok Let me be a straight shooter For an Asian guy you ain t really as smart when it comes to these things You see the governments around the world are telling people to stay home because that helps avoid the virus which is illegal because it s against our rights I do not see any so called world leaders telling this virus to stop infringing our human rights Why is the WHO not doing anything to stop this virus from attacking us when we go out What happened to the rules of engagement at that very moment I did not know where to cry or burst out laughing but whatever it is it was shocking But he continued Bob I mean instead of incarcerating us in our own houses why can not they make an effort to tell the virus to not attack good folk who are going out to grab a beer or having a barbecue or just going fishing Me Bob are you serious right now Are you f ing serious How the hell does anyone talk to a virus Can you talk to them Bob Hell I ain t no scientist hell you probably ain t even human I mean we got them millions of scientists with millions of dollars Why ain t they trying to communicate with the virus For those Harvard folk I really do not see them doing anything to at least try I ain t from Harvard and even I can think of that Heck maybe I should be President I d make those damn liberals and snowflakes shut up At that very moment I decided to call it a night and bid everyone in the chat good night I am still in disbelief a few days on And I look at us as Malaysians and begin to realize that despite being a developing nation our cooperative attitude may not be so bad at a time like this Reflecting back on news reports on how many people share this friends mentality I can not help but wonder if come November the same bloated peach with a combover gets re elected into the office of President Can not say I d be surprise if he wins But I would sum up the entire long conversation with the image below Edit Thank you guys for pointing out some grammatical errors My apologies as I wrote this in a rush and may have made some mistakes here and there Do let me know if you require any clarification UPDATE Bob saw this post and asked for a Zoom call early in the morning to somewhat apologize Had another colourful conversation Will consider sharing if I can filter through the profanities

For the first time in my life I have had to deal with hair loss, but luckily after the ""dormant"" phase of hair growth passed, I have a lot of new hair growing ? First, getting to the root of the stress and making some conscious changes, and secondly, loading my diet with hair healthy foods, such as eggs, salmon, spinach, almonds, avocado, pumpkin seeds and a lot of lean protein. In addition, I continued with some things that I was already doing such as vitalproteins in my coffee or matcha every morning, for the all important ! You can find them on Amazon.(swipe for all pictures). I also started taking Nourage vitamins thanks to the advice of oxana_meade They are an internal version of keratin (also on Amazon). Omega 3s, in the form of fish oil, are a must for a healthy body and healthy hair, and thanks to one of my sweet IG followers, I was turned on to Carlson Norwegian Fish Oil. After consulting my doctor, I doubled up on the dose, and I gulp down 2 spoonfuls every morning, over 3000 , I have to chase it with something tasty!! As far as what I am doing topically, melissaschleicher encouraged me to start using Zenagen shampoo for hair growth. It works! It's available at parlour3beauty and oxanasalon ... and lastly, once a week, I use renefurtererusa scalp treatment, which maximizes the scalp's nutrient intake, to encourage new growth. I have one vial left to use. So, there ya go. This is what is working for me. I highly encourage you, first, to see your physician, as I did, due to the weight and hair loss. Every circumstance is different. Relieving the stress is paramount, and a healthy diet goes without ! Much health and happiness to you! Xoxo, Mary . ‚ù§Ô∏è"

The O&M will put a line through the town grannie application if the surface is looking like it did last year. Plus the Rovers will need to be looking good for an O&M final plus O&K grannie.

5649,5649,"I am not happy with this cleaner. It ought to be labeled as a wood finish remover! I purchased this cleaner to remove some mildew and algae on my pressure treated deck. I had treated sealed my deck with two coats of Bear deck sealer 1 1/2 years ago. I followed the directions and mixed the product with an equal amount of water, sprayed with a backpack pump sprayer, let it sit for 3-4 minutes (directions say 5 minutes), and rinsed it off very thoroughly with the hose. I even applied during the morning hours to ensure that it wouldn't dry too quickly. Initially I didn't notice any change. I let it dry for an hour and came back only to find that it had eaten through TWO layers of Bear deck sealer down to the bare wood. It looks awful. Based on the smell, this stuff is just straight up bleach. Now I will have to buy more deck sealer and re-seal my deck. This stuff would be great if I wanted to completely remove the finish in order to paint or re-seal, but my intended use was to remove a thin layer of mildew and algae. DO NOT BUY!"

10552,10552,Reading Time mins Many people have lost their jobs from the coronavirus crisis while others have used self isolation to contemplate a new career Job hunting and work will be different in the months possibly years to come So how can you find work in the post COVID world and what should you expect How to find work Video interviews Home working Flexible childcare Tighter salaries or employee benefits More help How to find work Finding local work won t be a simple case of pavement pounding like before Businesses may be open but many will still operate from home Closed offices and premises might be off putting to job hunters but all you need to do is move your search online We ve got a hefty article here with ways to find a job many of which involve using the internet to source your next role You can also use local groups like Facebook groups or NextDoor to post your skills and that you re looking for work Many businesses will also post adverts on sites like Gumtree too It s worth updating your online CV on LinkedIn too lots of employers and recruiters use this to search for potential candidates Video Interviews Social distancing is likely to be in place for a long time after lockdown is lifted That means companies will want to avoid unnecessary contact with people who aren t staff or essential customers Also with more home working in place lately businesses have seen the light when it comes to the benefits of video calls It saves everyone time and keeps people safe too Make sure you have a suitable video call setup ready for your video interviews If you live with other people tell them when your interview is booked so they know not to disrupt you Set up a suitable background too sitting with your back to a window means the interviewer can t see you properly Headphones are entirely acceptable on video calls and often provide better audio quality than using your laptop or computer speakers If you re using your phone see if you can get a stand to keep it steady so you re not moving it during the interview Dress to impress too Video interviews still mean you re giving a first impression so dust off your business wear and brush your hair Home Working The majority of businesses that didn t have to close during lockdown moved their staff to remote working Some companies will want to bring everyone back to the office as soon as they can but many have now seen how remote working improves productivity When you re job hunting ask employers what they expect the current and future work environment to look like Will you have a socially distanced work space in an office Or could you work from home Perhaps it ll be a combination of the two If you start a new job that is fully remote your employer still has a duty of care to your work safety That includes your work station in an office your desk needs to meet certain criteria as does your chair and monitor At home they re supposed to carry out a workstation assessment but realistically that s unlikely to happen What you can do however is request reasonable equipment to ensure you can do your job from home safely For example if you re using a laptop on your sofa that s not doing your back and neck any good Ask for a small desk and laptop riser to help eliminate potential posture problems You might be given the option to work from home or the office Many people prefer an office environment so it s up to you but requesting the ability to work flexibly sometimes at home sometimes in the office will give you the best of both worlds While it s not a legal requirement to accept a request for flexible working it is a legal right of each employee to ask for it Flexible Childcare One of the reasons you might want to ask for flexible working when you re job hunting is childcare Even though businesses may reopen before September it looks like schools won t Arranging childcare when you re back at work and the children are at home is a handful During lockdown you probably got used to juggling home schooling with work or other responsibilities Use this to your advantage and suggest you work remotely on the days childcare isn t available Tighter Salaries or Employee Benefits Businesses have been hit hard in Even with Government financial support schemes they ll have suffered losses that could take a long time to recover Stagnation elsewhere such as the property market indicate an overall stalled economy for a time too This means your salary might not meet the expectations you had or that promotions will come quickly Even if things like the stock market bounce back fast it ll take a lot longer for those improvements to trickle down to salaries Job hunting means looking at the whole package to decide if you want to take the role Employee benefits such as subsidised gym memberships and private healthcare schemes may also be affected Voluntary additional pension contributions may not be in place either This doesn t mean you can t try to negotiate when you re accepting a job High unemployment however does mean it s an employer s market so you ll need to be realistic in your negotiations Ask your job search questions It s all still up in the air how everything s going to turn out later this year and into the future The things in this article are what we expect to happen but you could see more radical changes even than this

12499,12499,Everyone remain calm One of the most rewatchable shows of all time is getting revisited in a whole new way On Sept it was announced that two stars of the NBC sitcom The Office would be teaming up for a podcast about the hit show Basically Jenna Fischer and Angela Kinsey s new podcast about The Office is the best news I have heard about in a very long time and I am already preparing for all the nostalgia and behind the scenes nuggets of info that will come with it In matching Instagram posts real life besties Fischer and Kinsey who for any non Dunderheads other there played The Office leading ladies Pam and Angela respectively announced they would be launching a podcast all about their former show on Oct In each episode of the podcast titled Office Ladies Fischer and Kinsey will break down an episode and give exclusive behind the scenes details only people from the set would know In addition to deep cut trivia factoids and funny stories about filming Fischer said the duo will also discuss their present day lives including their IRL friendship their cats and their Target runs To be totally honest Fischer and Kinsey are so funny together both in the show and online I would listen to pretty much any kind of podcast they decided to make together Of course the fact that it s a podcast about The Office makes this project even more exciting I am already creating my wish list for which former costars they will bring on as guests though I will not reveal who my to choices are because I do not want to jinx it I am not superstitious but I am a little stitious The news of this podcast comes not long after the announcement that The Office will be leaving Netflix at the end of Assuming Office Ladies chronologically covers one of the TV show s episodes every week listeners will probably be up to somewhere in Season when the series leaves the streamer Luckily the comedy s departure from Netflix does not necessarily mean fans will have to listen to the rest of the podcast without being able to rewatch alongside Fischer and Kinsey The Office will have a new home on NBCUniversal s own streaming platform in so if you were on the fence about signing up for the new service this might help make up your mind According to Fischer and Kinsey s posts Office Ladies which is created in partnership with the podcast network Earwolf will be available on Apple Podcasts Stitcher Spotify and anywhere you can download podcasts so there will be plenty of new ways to get your fix of The Office I honestly can not decide what brings me the most joy about the creation of Office Ladies the reunion of Pam and Angela the ability to dive even deeper into the world of Dunder Mifflin or the fact that Michael Scott s famous line that s what she said is taking on a whole new non dirty meaning I think this new development is something even Stanley would crack a smile about

6807,6807,"Originally Posted by Joe///540i I¬ím not sure you¬íre right about it having to be reinitialized. I just had my windshield replaced twice in one week and stood over the installers. He told me it only needs to be reinitialized if you turn the key or start the car while the mirror is unplugged. I almost did this during the install and he caught me before I did and told me this. All my sensors are working fine. One may get away without re-initializing, but I think it becomes a crap shoot if the rain sensor will be properly calibrated and not too sensitive or not sensitive enough to mist on the windshield. TIS is explicit in its instructions to re-initialize (or initialize) whether installing a new, virgin, RLS or reusing an old one. BMW tech docs describe that the RLS has a learning function that adapts its response as the glass ages. One presumes by aging they mean the tiny micro pitting from road dirt that will change the reflectivity off the glass surface that the RLS uses to sense water on the windshield. Consider for instance the difference between an elderly windshield so pitted one is blinded driving into the sun compared to a brand new flawless windshield. Or the different windshield options, & or solar. The re-initialization is supposed to reset the module to a new starting point based on that particular windshield. Perhaps the advice from your installer is a mis-conception taking only part of the instruction set. IIRC, the sequence involves: - clean the windshield over the prism thoroughly of all dirt, grime, oil and wax - connect to the RLS with the diagnostic system - click on the ""reset"" button - leave the key in position 1 (or 2, not sure which) without starting the engine or changing the wiper stalk for 20 seconds - turn the key to ""off"" - then start the engine. The RLS should be correctly calibrated"

I know the Olympus Workspace is much less capable, but the colors it produces are far better than Capture One. Each of these programs has a problem: My main problem with Olympus Workspace is sharpness and fine details - not as good as the Capture O ? My main problem in Capture One is how to set the proper White Balance - no matter what I try it has kind of purple - pink cast in the image, visible mainly in large areas such as sky. Any idea to fix a proper white balance? Use the white balance ""picker"" and click on a neutral area on the photo. W is the keyboard shortcut. While I use Capture One Pro, I suggest that you take a look at DXO-Photolab Elite.

the long history of Suffering Spouse Sighs She shakes her head forcing her multitude of tiny thin microbraids to fly all about her face and closes her eyes Babe I Seriously legitimate In front of her Sarah Grey Lacklan is still dressed in her work clothes the green black and red attire top and shorts which accentuate her pale white muscle though her war paint has become smudged from her match She juts out her hip placing the majority of her weight on her right side so that she can balance JT Junior on her hip Her bright smile full of painstakingly cleaned teeth shines with all Billion And the best part about the whole dealio Dave got to have an excuse for losing AND some staff interaction Win Win situation for everyone Kenzi groans and turns to the television in the private lockerroom within the Synergy Arena and goes back to watching the live show At least now you can take care of that stupid fucking baby He s NOT stupid Kenzi shakes her head at the sudden roar from Sarah The former World Champion turns her smile to the baby in her arms and coos at him an act filled with You are the SMARTEST nearly stolen baby in the world aren t you Yes you are Yes you are which brings an appreciative giggle in return Even better We can give the stupid baby back to his stupid parents They are here Right now Sarah continues to ignore Kenzi and the caramel starlet sighs She turns back to the monitor and tries to focus on the Synergy broadcast instead and a smile comes across her face as Yamazaki launches Baal over his head with a throw and she clenches her fist as Burke counts the three However her eyes darken as the My Name is Human begins to play Sarah looks up from JT Junior eyes suddenly full of worry as she feels the sudden change in Kenzi Beloved What She cuts off as she sees the Astro Creeps surround the ring Ken its She is interrupted by Sebastian Everette Bryce coming to his teammate s rescue She walks forward and joins Kenzi standing at her side and watches the scene unfold Kenzi clenches her hands at her sides and shakes her head as Baal joins in the fray and chaos ensues they need help Then let the World Champion deal with it Kenzi looks up at Sarah her mouth opening to say something but then it closes when she sees the hard face of her wife For days I REIGNED And no one in that ring gave me credit Let their fucking hero come to their rescue Let us see if the World Champion will do more than just barely get by on Synergies Sarah turns on her heel and walks further to the other side of the room Come Beloved We have an early start tomorrow But babe wh Sarah turns on her heel again and the venom in her voice silences Kenzi I care about winning wrestling competitions Wife Not popularity contests Let my sister handle that nonsense Besides I have something I need to do once we get to the Waldorf anyway She turns on her heel again adjusts JT Junior on her hip and heads toward their bags Hey there Baby Birds Yes yes I said that I would NOT

comprised of teaming with Angie four times I have covered THAT enough for Infinity and literally only one singles match yet still walks around saying You aRe aFRaiD oF Me KeYBoaRD WaRRioR What a sad sack of shit I KNOW I made some people mad by dragging that dipshit through the mud and then putting on an Abyssal exclamation point but its kinda what I do But That is TOTALLY NOT why I am here Nope as I said before I m here to send a message to someone in particular Now I COULD literally say ALL of this like in person or by text or whatever but said person just recently become a premium subscriber to my new SAR Talks content so I wanted to reward them a touch by going THIS route instead of another So that being said Hey Cutie So a couple of things You look exhausted Like seriously Massive bags under your eyes that sixteen pounds of base can t hide no matter how hard you try A slow in your steps while you were fighting in that six person tag A lower and raspy tone to your voice It is apparent that you are not exactly at Now we haven t actually talked about it or anything yes yes I know I haven t been around much in the past few weeks I ll take the blame on that but I get the feeling that it stems from something outside of the ring After all the past few weeks have been good for you You won earlier tonight you snapped that pre IYH losing streak you ve been getting good publicity you ve got that Carnage Ultraviolent title match coming up and more Things are good there But that means something is bugging you OUTSIDE of the ring and it is SHOWING everywhere else And you KNOW how I feel about that Just in case you forgot You hiding your face in shame because of the revelation that you have this sordid second job that in case you have noticed I have been like the COOLEST person and friend for NEVER asking about Me gives sage advice about how important it is to keep separation between in and out of ring because MAN shitty stuff happens You NEED to keep the things OUT of this ring well OUT of it You NEED to not let your family relationships interfere You NEED to not let your other work relationships interfere You NEED to be able to focus on the match in front of you If not Sharks like me will eat you alive You are my friend Sloane Yes yes I KNOW that YOU know I m a TOUCH rough around the edges and therefore don t have too many friends but you don t understand the depth of how difficult it is for me to call someone friend SOME of that found its way onto the airwaves a few years ago see the above advice while dining at Lula Cafe but the full reality is that trusting anyone beyond a hello is intensely difficult Hell my BEST GODDAMN non spouse FRIEND literally LIED to me for sixteen goddamn MONTHS ya know So trust issues yeah And I trust you I trusted you from the first moment you said you didn t know about the attack on my Beloved Which means that I care about you I care that you are once again finding yourself in a position to have the sharks of our industry find you a fine snack Please be careful and get some sleep Please for the love of all that is holy dumb that do nothing penniless ne er do well boyfriend of yours No really I totes have a selfie with Lady Gaga Pretty freakin cool moment So Match on Monday Now I KNOW that Sloane vs Sarah hasn t gone the BEST for you in our limited meetings thus far discounting that last minute sub for Kenzi you re when facing me but I hope that you appreciate that I ve endeavored to have our contests as clean as possible No cheap tactics no trickery no funny business Just two smokin hawt and talented young athletes who enjoy the love of the Art of Sports that is wrestling And while I DO owe you a MASSIVE punch in the teeth for a variety of things Maggie and Ichabod Are you fucking INSANE that is NOT what this Monday is about No matter what the actual breakdown of this match is on paper the REAL match is this The Lacklan Sisters the Cutie and the Dunce Kicking Some Astro Creep Ass THAT is what this needs to be dearie Remember how right after Outlast we had me and Kenzi teaming with Vapid and Useless against Team Slebby and Rydell And how all of us were all Oops Did we turn this into a on beatdown because of the attack on Angie Cher MyBad gif And then how earlier this year we had some House of Lacklan members against you T Pie and Dave and again we were all Oopsie daisy We fucked up Dave again Silly us Well this is literally the same thing Tempest and I were able to co exist for five seconds which got all KINDS of weird but we all know that he and his little co op of creeps want more than just what is good and right with the world And in case you don t quite remember please allow me to introduce you to one of the Digital Pigeons I literally sent you Sarah is the best Sarah number one Do NOT trust Gabriel Baal Remember that I haven t slid into someone s DMs that fast since before I was married And that was because this is IMPORTANT DO NOT TRUST GABRIEL BAAL Our job my friend is to corral out cooperative partners into understanding that the Greater Good is served by giving the Astro Creeps an epic beatdown like it was the Cool Kids vs Zane Scott THAT was fun Our job is to get Donovan to leave Aloof Donovan Hastiboard I IZ TEH CAPTAIN NOW behind and instead being the man with the most World Title reigns second most Main Event wins and third most title wins in Coalition history And my job is to get my sister to leave behind the trappings of the famous Maine sentiment of SSDD and embrace the loaded beat that once put some random Twitter THOT into a coma It is OUR job to set aside if for but a moment the desire to win a professional wrestling match and instead give an American History X style beatdown only THIS time its the Bad Guy who gets the curb stomp This isn t just about some fun wrestling competition as a go home before No Holds Barred This is about the Good Guys taking out the Bad Guys before they get a chance to fester into a company killing cancer Join me my friend Twilight Sparkle> Pinkie Pie Thank you for attending this SAR Talk Loralee Van Vleet of the Illinois Van Vleets of course had been working as a Realtor capital R of course for Coldwell for fifteen years A beautiful blonde woman with a mean streak a mile wide she had risen through the ranks of the company with a blend of power and grace that left her enemies trembling in fear and her supporters shaking in a mixture of desire and awe She closed on more houses than the next three Realtors even showed combined And she always ALWAYS got a cut from her deals which left her boss blinking his eyes in clueless adoration But she was powerless in the face of THIS set of customers Does the garage have soundproofing I don t want KITT to think things are too loud Too many families in this neighborhood I hate kids NEXT Hmmmm This shade of white is a TOUCH too eggshell I REALLY was looking for something closer to alabaster Nope Too many white people saying dumb shit These two women she wasn t sure if the baby was theirs one said Absolutely this is our baby while the other said Ah HELL naw that ain t my stupid baby had been insufferable A very audible Cha CHING had blared in her ears when she had gotten the call from a woman named Ashley a personal assistant who was setting up a meeting for them The clients who were looking for a condo in the Lake Forest area were supposedly wealthy minor celebrities and money would be no object Unfortunately that had translated to several days of utter condo shopping hell for the Realtor NOTHING was good enough for them This here is this real gold Oh God It s only karat What do you want me to do Loralee walk into an archway like a PAUPER This is far too close to that pond I can t swim Ugh I specifically asked for a yard with GREEN grass And speaking as a Lawn Grass Expert I can tell you that THIS lawn will turn FAR too chartreuse in the winter for my liking Nuh uh The closest Popeye s is way too far away She had almost found a sale and an expensive one to boot in the form of that old Gothic manor but it didn t work out OH EM GEE This one is AMAZING Wow It IS really elegant Sar This is it Beloved I am inspired But I ll need to update my wardrobe when we stay here Really That s great I The sleeves need to be even MORE puffy NEXT She had lost count of how many times she had gotten into their car one of them insisted on doing all the driving and had her head slammed against the seat she drove like a maniac and gone to another house They had criss crossed all of Lake Forest times Babe there ARE other places No Sloane said that THIS is the BEST place in ALL of Illinois well at least near to Chicago to raise a family I don t care what YOUR Cutie said THE Cutie and she had listened to that particular argument at least times all the while turning down place after place And while they were at the condos They picked apart everything Hmmm I ALMOST like this basement but I really would prefer that it has a least SOME sex dungeon aesthetic already in place These folks get B E T here Not moving in if its nothing but that BritBox shit and squabbled over minutiae Ugh I m only getting bars on my phone is NOT okay The hot tub is WAY too far away from the kitchen and got caught trying to have sex in just about every location Well how ELSE are we supposed to know if the chandelier will hold my weight We need to see how thick these walls are bb She had given up all hope had given up on a sell streak of years coming to an end until the impossible happened They arrived at North Mckinley Road Built less than years ago the square foot condo had three bedrooms two and a half baths every upgrade available at the time and a starting price of one penny under a million dollars She had dropped the price TWICE since it went on the market but even in the upper area of Lake Forest the price tag was far too high for anyone with any common sense or understanding of real estate economics They loved it We ll take it You take cash Sar doesn t let me write checks anymore That s because you bounce them like we re stuck in the s shit up Papers were being signed before she knew what was happening These two odd little women and the baby who may or may not have been theirs were a whirlwind of activity that had her head spinning The biggest sale of her career was happening in less than Do I smell cloves Loralee s heart stops at the pale one s question Standing in the front yard of the condo the three women and baby had been discussing the neighborhood when the stink musk of cloves which had not been a popular smoking item for twenty years wafted over to them please no please please please We re so goth The three women turn and see that a small line of black was making their way over to them A tall and skinny man with pasty white skin as bright as the pale woman but without any of the healthy sheen wearing a fedora and utilizing a walking stick A fat man with half of his stomach falling out of his Nine Inch Nails t shirt A third man with a haircut filled with so much designer gel that it stood a full three feet out from his head and ran parallel to the ground Loralee did her best to hold in her sigh and put on her biggest smile And these three um handsome young gentlemen would be some of your neighbors The three men get closer but stop several feet from them which was good in this time of social distancing And even though both of her clients faces were mostly covered with masks the type and color had changed every day sometimes several times a day and each had been beautiful and clearly designed with a talented hand she could still feel the grotesque lust emanating from the three She sees that the pale woman gives them a small nod and the darker one subtly hid behind her wife blocking her face behind the platinum hair She had done that when they first met early in the week too as if she were trying to not let even half her face be seen but had loosened up as the week had gone on M Ladies While Loralee had been able to keep the sigh buried and most of the disgust she was unable to hold back the groan when the man tipped his fedora and gave them some elaborate bow out of the Middle Ages The fat one he didn t speak much just stood there and breathed hard while looking at the three of them and the one with the dumbest hair she had ever seen licked his lips charmed The pale woman s voice was full of guarded sarcasm and she shot her a look with those weird red eyes of hers She had never seen the like and she had done a triple take when she first met her and she still found herself unsure of what to think of them But when she looked back she could see the woman stand a little straighter and a brightness come to those eyes We are to be your new neighbors at least for a portion of the time Tell me What do you three do We are Loralee closes her eyes again knowing what was about to happen and again feeling the biggest sale of her career slipping away This group and their other friend had been the cause of more than one exodus from the overly expensive condo warlocks The thin man waved his hands in the air and a flash come to life with a pop and smoke rose out of his hand The pale woman seemed unimpressed by the magic display which Loralee knew for a fact was ordered from the back of a comic book catalogue but the darker woman jumped Ah HELL naw Get me out of her Loralee FUCK dis magic shit It took her and the pale woman a few minutes to calm her down the pale one said something about how black people didn t do magic while sighing several times but they eventually found themselves listening to the three men explain themselves WE are the COVEN of ETERNAL DARKNESS We invade the DREAMS of lesser men and women We make their minds PLAYTHINGS to our MAGICAL SKILL We SOLD our SOULS to the great CHROMATIC dragon himself KING TIAMAT so that we could bring fire and thunder and RUIN to our enemies Fear the CREEPS of the world for OUR feet are in both YOUR Prime Material plane AND in the Other Side And through our GREAT POWERS we are able to Jesus I hate the InstaGoths The thin man s voice falters and the hair of the third man becomes deflated and falls Loralee wasn t sure what the pale woman meant but she was about to learn something Listen boys I fully get the need or desire to create a departure from the real world for yourself Hell I used to think I was a vampire See I had this whole dissociative thing right Literally no one else in my life was an albino especially not one as terribly beautiful as me and I needed to find SOMETHING in the world which would help me make some sense out of it so BLAM Vampire Actually Loralee had heard of people literally throwing up their finger into the air and saying Actually but had never seen it until the man with the dumb hair did it right then WE are vampires Our coven is full of vampire warlocks who control the WORLD Watch us drink blood for sustenance As a unit as if they had rehearsed it times behind closed doors the three of them reach into their pockets and pull out small vials of a red liquid They twist open the vials and go to drink them but they are stopped by the sudden laughter of the pale woman And not just laughter But bent over at the waist laughter It takes many moments for her to upright herself her cheeks as red as her eyes and calm down The fuck is that Is that Clamato I bet that s Clamato The guilty look in the eyes of the three give them all the answer they need and the darker woman gives voice to how they all feel before the pale one goes off again gross Good Lord you three I literally used to walk around with a vial around my neck too but that contained ACTUAL blood from ACTUAL enemies Bless the smooth bottom of Baby Jesus but YOU guys are as comically derivative as the Astro Creeps The three look at themselves with confused looks and the woman s face falls Oh come ON You guys HAVE to know who we are More confusion and Loralee understood The lady on the phone said something about minor celebrities and The G Ls Team Kickass The Mafia Lots of confusion and the woman throws up her hands Oh for fucks sake We re wrestlers Literally wrestle in THIS COUNTY every week on TV Shrugged shoulders and she turns toward her wife Beloved Remind me to speak to the Coalition marketing team She grumbles about market penetration as she turns back to the trio of goths warlocks vampires Anyway we re wrestlers right And in our profession there is a tendency to hype up theatrics Usually just for marketing purposes like selling swag and the like but also for mind games Like if you can convince your opponent that you re something you re not they ll prepare for THAT and then BLAM You nail the with what you REALLY are That make sense More confused glances and the pale woman shakes her head Take me for example I spent a couple of years convincing the world I was this dumb vlogger right Only cared about getting likes and shares and stuff And then BLAM Got in the ring choked out some bitches won some titles set the world on fire It was super effective at the time But over the years there have been OTHER examples of this examples which ranged from scary to creepy to downright s slasher style stupidity which is beyond laughable Like YOU three And the Creeps for that matter Ya see there is this trio of tryhards right One of them wrestles another talks I m not sure what the third one actually does Her eyes take in the tall man the one with the dumb hair and the fat man in turn and they all engage in this well trickery in order to gain a mental advantage It works on some of course but not the elite That s a part of what makes people at my level the elite ya know I m not World Class for nothing And unfortunately for them those mind games are becoming less and less effective as people are exposed to them because THEY are becoming exposed for the charlatans they are The woman starts pacing suddenly moving in tight lines and Loralee blinks several times So do the three neighbors who have caused so much trouble in the past But not the dark skinned woman Loralee could be wrong but she was pretty sure she saw desire in those dark eyes as they watched her partner pacing Our names are Grey Lacklan by the way and that means a LOT for those who know better Yes we wrestle on your television sets every week providing fresh content in a sea of Same Shit Different Day offered by so many others but we re not just wrestlers of TODAY ya know I mean yes we are GREAT examples of the modern day wrestler Us kids today We travel across the world not caring about putting down roots or ruffling feathers and fight every style in every land And we rejoice in how the fans flock to us the competitors fear us and the owners pay us Sure I ve turned away from the overall freelancer mentality of my peers and have become exclusive to Chicago but you don t EVEN want to know about the contract I got from various bosses in my career But apart from being modern wrestlers We re also students of our sport While a LOT of people I see these days we re talking names like Raab and Rydell but you should really just kinda forget them are just here for the pin me and pay me part of the business we have a LOVE for it that is both nature and nurture Both my Beloved and I are second generation wrestlers my father was a wrestler and I literally grew up in a town that considers wrestling a religion don t ask legit don t ask and Kenzi s sweet loving understanding and accepting mother was also a champion and they raised us to love what they did Well MY father did anyway Kenzi s wanted her to stay the hell away from anything which might wreck her acting career but that s just silly Loralee notices the dark woman momentarily flinch and try to cover herself up again and we DID love it I traveled the world with Daddy as a child and I learned to navigate the politics of the business as a valet and Kenzi grew up determined to not only do as well as my wonderful Step Mumsie but be BETTER than her We both learned the importance of promotion of selling tickets and of bringing home the winner s paycheck And as an extension of that we have embroiled ourselves in the business tenfold as adults Hell even my no longer secret siblings are wrestlers AND my wife s vapid and useless friend We are ALL wrestlers living in the world of modern wrestling living and BREATHING our business And I in particular have fallen in love with the history of it See I m the historian of my little group I know things about people that wannabe armchair psychologists like the der we re more than human hur creeps I compared you to couldn t even comprehend And that s not really a dig on your intelligence or anything because I do a LOT of research And part of that research is that I don t JUST know about modern wrestling I don t JUST know about wrestling in the s like Daddy or Kenzi s mumsi did I don t JUST know about wrestling in the golden age of television and the regional boom of the s to s but I ALSO know about the very beginnings of the sport back when it was held in carnivals and festivals back before we had a square to go with the circle And it is because of THAT knowledge that I and perhaps I alone know just how full of shit the Astro Creeps are And YOU three for that matter She stops suddenly and takes them in Let me guess The fireball came from Spenser s Gifts at the mall The man with the dumb hair hems and haws for a moment and the pale woman clenches her fist in victory before begining to pace on the condo s lawn again But she stops as an ominous voice fills the air What be going on here my Children of the Dark The three men stand straighter as they all turn their heads toward the sound of the voice A tall and thin man with dark hair walked toward them and Loralee groaned again The man who carried himself with such an important air was the real reason behind so many buyers pacing on the condo Sire The three goths fell to their knees and held out their hands wrist up beckoning to be bitten oh sweet Jesus The tall man looks at the pale woman with a pained face and opens his mouth Allow me to Listen literally everyone knows how YOU are supposed to be in this scenario The man s mouth clamps shut and she waves at him with agitation Let me guess Master manipulator with dreams and schemes far above mortal men and women and you win and lose on purpose at everything you ve ever done in your life You win only when you want to and lose so as to further entrap the victims of your schemes and NOT as a shitty as FUCK excuse for when a supposed world beating badass gets beat by someone half his size and he doesn t have a plausible excuse as to why which would fit his narrative His mouth opens and shuts several times and the woman goes right back into her pacing Stand there and look pretty while I continue okay I was just getting to the fun stuff You see back in the day And I mean WAY back in the day Wrestling wasn t commissioned Neither was boxing for that matter And promoters had to do a LOT of bullshit tricks to get people through the door See The family swinging from the flying trapeze See The bearded lady See The man swallowing swords and breathing fire See The strongman lifting weights beyond imagination And in that in all of that circus horseshit were charlatans like Baal and the Astro Creeps Wrestlers who used sleight of hand and mirrors to wow and amaze a clueless audience Wrestlers who would flip and fly as if they themselves were above the safety nets in order to confuse the audience with spectacle Wrestlers who would employ magic in order to keep their crowd riveted And mostly because lets face it they didn t have the skill to otherwise stay employed as successful combat sports competitors And that s where the Creeps come in And from the looks of it you guys too Lord you four are probably as bad for the reputation of this neighborhood as THEY are for wrestling All that parlor trick bullshit they do Nothing more than the guys fighting in smoke filled tents from a hundred years ago Might as well grow out some shitty curled mustaches like some lame hipster wear black and white striped long underwear and put up their dukes ya know what I m saying Loralee tries not to stare TOO hard at the hipster mustache that the man with the dumb hair is trying to grow And for all I know just like the Creeps YOU guys may even BELIEVE your own horse shit Along with the magician s fireball do you guys bust out the fake levitation where you do a calf raise on the curb or go for ginormous leaps and bounds into the air Bet you are JUST as bad as Baal Like HE may even BELIEVE that the world DOES do his bidding by communicating with his blinks and subtle raises of his eyebrow Hell HE may EVEN BELIEVE that he s FREAKIN WOLVERINE and that NOTHING can harm him no matter HOW FUCKING DUMB some of his matches are While her hands wave wildly in the air as she yells she suddenly stops in front of the dark woman and chews her lips in thought Ya know they MAY have something there Like this one time Back before I realized how goddamn USELESS Chaos matches where I was in this hardcore tounament right Remember that NGIW tournament Beloved Same month you won WrestleStock Well Josh Kennedy hit me with a Flaming Dragon Uppercut right And I mean like literally flaming Like his entire arm was on fire right Because I set it on fire And he was all WAAAAA DRAGON UPPERCUT and knocked my squat booty right out of the tournament And like two days later I didn t even have a freakin SCAR to show for it I asked Lisa Seldon you remember Lisa why that was since she s a legit deathmatch master but she just kinda shrugged her shoulders and told me not to ask too many questions So maybe some of us DO have cray cray healing factors She shrugs her shoulders and doesn t seem to notice the other woman try to subtly hide her face even more before she turns back to the four men in black Anyway in case you losers haven t noticed I keep talking about this whole reality thing which I am VERY aware you know fuck all about and unfortunately for you I m going to keep harping on it Because this is NOT a work of fantasy This is NOT a world of magic and levitation and fireballs and creepy guys trying to invade your dreams or whatever the fuck the Creeps try to do in the course of preparing for a wrestling competition And I will NOT abide by YOU dipshits doing the same thing in our new well part time anyway neighborhood The reality is that yes Baal and the Creeps are at home in the carnivals of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries THEY may be a leftover vestige of when wrestling had to survive as a sideshow act in the company of trained elephants clowns stuffed in undersized cars and a ground covered in popcorn and peanut shells but I am not I was bred raised and trained to fight in arenas I AM the person that entire companies fought over so that I can be their face their media star their main event a battle won by the Coalition THEY may be the people who find themselves fighting in avenues where the stench of funnel cake permeate the air but I am the person who gets plastered on billboards so that the all important sell out happens And while by no means do I always find myself in the winner s circle champions and members of halls of fame have found that the nature and nurture of wrestling in me has created an opponent with shockingly effective skills She stops suddenly and points a finger at the tall man with the smarmy face the sire of the trio I am QUITE aware that people like you and Baal think of yourselves as the intellectual mastermind of the world as people who pull the strings of the puppets to watch them dance I am QUITE aware that you guys delight in seeing your shenanigans cause change both in your own house and the world at large But oh Grand Poobah of the Chris Angel Fanclub or whatever the fuck people like you and Baal are allow me to give you a small spoiler something to which will cause you to clutch your pearls and be in need of pulling out a wedgie Sarah looks around her eyes shifting with the spirit of conspiracy and leans forward I m smarter than you both She giggles which Loralee thought was an odd sound especially muffled through the mask and gives him a wink Final dose of reality for you guys and I hope that Gabriel Baal hears this through the ether or whatever dumb shit he ll rip off from a book written by a more talented man and bastardized to make him seem smart to his peers I m faster Slicker Smarter I have more talent drive and pedigree And when people like Baal stand next to me The entire world will realize that yes whereas I am the glittering diamond meant to characterize and represent this business whereas I am the future role model of an entire generation of women wrestlers he and his newfound buddies really are just the bearded lady or the contortionist or even just the clown making balloon animals before slipping on their banana peel Loralee finds herself blinking several times again as the awkward silence stretches on the lawn of the condo until she finds it within her to break it So when are you moving in The pale one gives her a smile and shakes her head Oh we re not moving in This is just for work Ya see we work in Chicago on Mondays well not EVERY Monday just most of them like about or so Mondays across the year and we re tired of staying at the Waldorf and She sees the foursome in black slink away to their own condo next door no doubt to pray to Satan or whatever and shakes her head in confusion Wait you re just planning on being here once a week And not even every week What No That would be silly We ll be here on Tuesdays too We fly in on Monday well drive in these days we find it MUCH easier to just roadtrip it from SoCal during this whole pandemic situation work Monday night rest on Tuesday and leave Wednesday after we break our fast Loralee had always had a good head for numbers and the math involved flew through her mind about or so Mondays plus Tuesdays days out of the year A million dollar condo If they did this for years it would cost them nearly a night to stay We are going to save SO much money this way huh Beloved Makes sense to me babe A part of Loralee s soul died as they finished signing the papers

11850,11850,"The Rug Doctor Pro Deep carpet cleaner is a great home carpet cleaner. The suction is very strong, and it pulls out nearly all of the water that you put down. The carpet is left clean and just a little damp. I have found that it dries in about an hour or two, at least in this hot weather. The clean tank holds 1.5 gallons and you mix in the solution in with hot water. This unit is very similar to the ones that you can rent at your local grocery store, but you don\u2019t have to worry about it having someone else\u2019s germs on it. It\u2019s a fairly heavy unit but moves back and forth pretty easily, but turning it is a little cumbersome. It\u2019s very wide and I was able to do a few rooms in my house that are 20x20 each and I was done in about 30 minutes. The handle folds down for storage also. Emptying the dirty water tank is easy, but you will make a little mess when you drain it\u2026. dirty water will drip out of the intake tube if you empty it right away, at least that was my experience with it. Perhaps if I had waited a while, it would have dried out and not dripped so much. It has a solution empty indicator and a brush jam indicator as well to alert you of trouble. I do think the power cord is a little short and I would have liked it to be about 5 feet longer than it is. You get a small bottle of cleaning solution that will be good for 3 gallons, but I went out and purchased the Pet solution bottle. Buying this carpet cleaner is a great value, it works great and if it\u2019s built like the rental units, it will last you a long time."

4782,4782,At the start of lockdown I remember longing for life to return to normal I imagine we ve all expressed this either in our heads or out loud at some point Five weeks into lockdown and I m not only struggling to recall what normal is but I m beginning to wonder if it s normal we want or just the comfort of hanging on to things that we had become so accustomed to It s dawned on me this week that there are a number of things about normal that I hope do not return and many more things that I hope become permanent once this whole pandemic is over Patience I think it would be fair to say that we were all more than a little irritated when the much needed hair clippers took two weeks to arrive instead of the usual hours Over the last few weeks I ve had to repeatedly explain to my offspring that a worldwide pandemic means fewer postmen social distancing in warehouses and thus a bit of patience required on our part In short we ve had to reluctantly accept that Prime no longer means next day The thing is our kids have grown up in a world where normal means getting what we want immediately I ve known for a long time that this instant society is not good for us I think this forced patience might have done us all some favours More Compassion One of the things that I ve found difficult to swallow these last few weeks is the judgement that this whole pandemic seems to have ignited Perhaps it s because we have little else to do but if you re a Twitter addict like me you will have noticed that people seem intent on tearing others down and pointing the finger at anyone who is not doing things their way For my own mental health I ve had to step away from social media on more than one occasion during lockdown I ve realised that we cannot judge others situations as they will almost certainly be different from our own Tempted as I am obsessing over what others should or should not be doing during this season is an unhealthy pastime It s much better to just tend to my own garden I am hoping that I adopt this mentality for good Slowing Down I ve never been good at resting I m a doer by nature and get my kicks from ticking things off a list and mastering new skills It might have taken me a good few weeks but I m finally beginning to see the benefits of slowing down I no longer wake up and mentally run through of my to do list before I ve taken my head off the pillow I still tend to give myself one reasonable task per day for sanity s sake but on the whole I ve been quite happy just pottering I didn t think that I would ever say this but I no longer feel as though I lack purpose I m truly embracing the opportunity to rest and I think it s doing me the world of good Even my husband has noticed that I m much calmer than normal so that has to be a good thing Community Spirit Whilst some people are judging others are stepping up to the plate and doing anything they can to support those around them The many selfless acts being carried out have negated the nastiness floating around and I ve been encouraged to try to do the same Having been furloughed from work I m in the fortunate position of having more time on my hands than usual It s been a pleasure to run even the smallest of errands for my elderly neighbours who I normally have no contact with from one month to the next I ve also enjoyed volunteering at our local community hub a couple of times per week Seeing the joy on people s faces as you leave a car load of food on their doorstep is priceless Our community hub has been overrun with people signing up to volunteer so much so that they ve had to turn people away This is what true community looks like and I hope that it stays Changing Priorities You know what I haven t missed Buying new clothes I know Not so long ago the thought of going a whole month without buying something new to wear would have been a challenge I m now more than two months in and haven t given clothing websites more than a second glance Looking at the drop in clothing sales I know that I m not alone in this Maybe it s because I m not seeing anyone other than the people I m doing my level best to avoid in the condiments aisle but for the most part it all just feels frivolous My priorities have changed and for the better Greater Appreciation For me this season has put a spotlight on so many of the simple things in life nature people my home friendship things that we so often take for granted I m appreciating the friends and family that I miss more than ever Even the people I am doing life with right now although intensely annoying at times keeping it real as always are blessing me in so many ways Then of course there are the key workers who we ve probably all taken for granted until now refuse and postal workers cleaners teachers supermarket assistants NHS workers and so many more Week and I ve felt strangely more content than at any other time during lockdown Remember last week when I said that I was feeling under pressure to do it right Forget learning a new language or becoming the funnest mum on the planet I think I might have just worked it out I ve taken the pressure off myself am starting to embrace certain aspects and am adjusting to a new life much of which I will be clinging onto when this is over I sincerely hope that the new normal looks a little different than it used to Please don t hold me to this I m well aware that a we are in unusual circumstances and b a leopard rarely changes its spots

3301,3301,There are a certain contingent of Star Wars fans that need it explained to them that Star Wars is not sci-fi. It's a fictitious religion based fantasy set in a technologically advanced society. Lord of The Rings in space if you will. A director who realises this is free to direct how he pleases and not be limited by the constraints of strict sci-fi. When George Lucas tried to put a scientific basis behind The Force with his metachlorian nonsense he did far more damage than the injection of Raiders of The Lost Ark style humour into the latest Star Wars episode. I liked the humour. I genuinely laughed. The saga of the trials of the Skywalker family down the ages and their struggles with The Force is a heavy heavy thing. The levity introduced in this episode gives one time to take a breather from all the doom and dire consequence. What Luke did with The Force in this film is a new level of awesome in my book. A reluctant but true master Jedi. My only real issue wih the film concerns Snoke and his origins. Maybe this will be tackled at a later date. Who knows.

11621,11621,The days blended together Merla lost track of how many it had been since the concert such is the way of living in the Court of Summer With spring on it s way too and the days getting longer there was more happening both inside and outside of the Inner Court She was not idle the Daughter of Fae Discreetly so as to not give away her plans too early commission various artisans and textile workers for items she needed or pieces that needed tending to The craftsmanship of the fey was unmistakable and this time when she returned I am going back There is too much that needs to be done and I need to ensure none of it touches my home she would not hide her origins what was starting to become Merla saw it in the way the fey she talked to spoke to her She became fully aware of it that night after the performance when she had spoken to Durdys She had looked at me in awe Fear I thought it was because of my words but A memory sharp and clear comes to her mind Sunday rolls away from her and bounces back to her feet in one fluid motion casually wiping the blood from her nose from the percussive note she had unleashed She stops short though when she looks at her as Sheryl feels the power of the Summer Lands coursing through her veins altering her form She leaps forward but Sunday ever the stronger fighter uses her connection to nature to throw her off balance Her tumble is not as graceful and she falls back the connection to her home breaking and she feels lesser Sunday stands over her a wary expression on her face and her voice sharp Why did you do that Was that your power or hers Could it be A light nip at her arm brings Merla back to the present Ow What was that for Lumina s scaled head tilts to the side You aren t sharing any of the apple pie with me You said you d get me my own Where is it I told you I could only get the one We are sharing Lu It s what friends do share Maybe your mortal friends But I am better than them the faerie dragon says Her scales shimmer gold as her wings flap a little to show her indignation And so I am owed my own pie You will make do with half of this one You do not wish to be so fat you cannot fly do you Merla gives her a look I know you sneak to the kitchens in the morning Lu The little dragon sticks its tongue out and gives a little hiss but goes back to delicately eating her portion of the pie no longer eyeing Merla s piece she put to the side They sit under the young Oak tree outside of the Garden Maze Merla lays back against the trunk and closes her eyes the sunlight through the branches casting dizzying shadows across her eyes What troubles you Lumina asks between mouthfuls casually Don t think I haven t noticed you making preparations to leave Merla s eyes snap open and she has a moment of panic But she calms herself This isn t like the last time I have more to bargain with than I did before So you are spying on me now is what she says teasingly The faerie dragon looks back at her licking her lips of the sweet apple filling Merla sits up shaking her head at her companion She pushes over her portion of the pie no longer interested in having the sweet dessert Lumina doesn t hesitate starting to devour what remains of Merla s portion A few moments pass Have I changed Lu she asks out of the blue Lumina doesn t answer deciding to continue to eat the crumbly pie crust It s nearly gone I feel like I have Merla continues I feel like I m not the same girl who left a year ago She fiddles with her hair while she continues looking at the change in it s colour Of course the experiences I ve gone through would have changed me I know that But what I mean is When I was Over There in Kantas I trained with Sunday Lumina s tail twitches but she continues to lick up the remaining crumbs and there was a point where I I don t know how to describe it but it s like I call upon the Wilds upon the Summer Court itself and I become more Anyways Sunday said she saw the Queen when she looked at me that one time Since the concert I ve had fey speak to me in such a way that it makes me wonder Am I changing Lumina pushes the plate away and gets up to come over to Merla Her tail flicks back and forth as she steps onto the small woman s lap and then up her torso so she is looking directly at her eye to eye Yes you have changed You gave me your pie You never would have before She leans in and nuzzles Merla s cheek her softer scales tickling Merla laughs lights and airy You are right though she says pulling back to hold the small dragon in her arms I am making preparations It s really bad out there Lu I had to come back home before we could really find out anything But if the people who want to sow chaos across the Planes succeed all of this will change I feel like I need to go back There s still things for me to do After a moment Lumina says I will miss you And I you my precious Lu Merla says holding her closer I ll be back though I promise So you see there is more going on than a simple cult wishing to open these gates across the Planes the small woman explains to the Great Seelie Queen her hands helping to express her point There is also the involvement of these mysterious inter planar pirates which seem to have ties to the very same nation which we fought to protect during the war This may or may not be connected to the seals and Gates or it may be something else entirely However it s all too coincidental with too many unknowns She takes a breath and gathers her courage I believe that if I can go back if I can continue investigating with people like Markas the monk I told you about who like me has found allies in this organisation the Harmonious Order we can get ahead of their plans and stop what they are attempting to do Titania studies her for a moment her expression severe calculating Merla had been speaking with her for a little over an hour telling stories about her most recent adventures She told her of the Harmonious Order of the Vanguard of the seals they were looking to break and the Gates they were looking to open The Queen had asked few questions letting the child tell her what she knew and she had listened Merla for her part had been both excited and nervous during the last hour She had awoken that morning knowing today would be the day she would ask if she could go back to Kantas She might not get the chance again She had not seen Krux in days had not in fact seen him since they were both on stage performing Merla hoped she would see him again before she left but she wouldn t wait for him This is too important It was just the two of them in the grand hall where she had performed some days before the space vast and empty Titania her ten foot tall majestic and powerful form beautiful wheat coloured hair tied back in a plait woven with leaves of orange gold and Merla petite and lithe a smaller less resplendent reflection of the towering archfey painted a very fascinating picture To Merla it felt like it was just the two of them but she still says the next part softly I know I have only just returned to you but I feel this is something I need to do These schemes and threats are no small thing and I can help Merla kneels down in front of Titania putting her hand over her heart I would like to return to Kantas with your blessing Mother she says bowing her head She stays there waiting Hoping A deeply tanned hand reaches out and lifts her chin up Titania smiles softly at her and Merla feels her heart soar Stand child she says her voice gentle beckoning Merla gets up and Titania considers her for a moment You have told me many things these last few weeks some which concern me greatly Her hand falls to the pommel of the sword she wears I do not take kindly to anything threatening my realm or my people The emotions that flit across her face reflect the storm clouds which have been seen circling around the Court She closes her eyes and her face goes tranquil once more Fortunately I have the perfect agent who already knows the ins and outs of the situation When she opens her eyes Merla sees the Warrior Queen looking back at her I will allow you Daughter to return to Kantas on the following conditions the Great Seelie Queen says You continue to involve yourself in the occurrences that most threaten the stability of the Planes but not to the exclusion of all else As she says the words Merla feels the stirrings of powerful oath and binding magics swirl around her being woven into existence with the Summer Queen s words Her heart quickens as she feels an answering call within her You will return once every full moon to update me regularly of the situation she smiles bewitchingly bringing with you the latest stories and songs Titania waves her hand and out of thin air appears a delicate feather circlet the same one Merla wore during the concert Except it now bears a small jewel embedded in the centre The gem glows like a small sun as Titania holds it above Merla who is mesmerised by the beautiful fiery oranges yellows and pinks she sees flickering in its depths Like the heart of the Summer Court itself Realising what she intends to do Merla bows her head and Titania places the circlet upon her The oath magics shift rippling over her lifting her up whilst enveloping her in their inescapable bonds This will bring you and only you back to me All you need do is concentrate on the Song and you will come home Merla looks up at the Summer Queen surprised That is the first time she has ever spoken about it since But the thought cuts off and Titania gives her a knowing look like she read her mind Merla lowers her head in acceptance and is about to speak but the Great Seelie Queen holds up her hand You may perform for the mortals in their taverns on the battlefields even for the fallen soldiers laying on their deathbeds she leans forward and Merla s heart leaps as she feels the magic twist around her winding its way up to her throat where her voice is poised and ready She does not flinch holding Titania s gaze but you will save your best songs for me and no one else Her face is level with Merla s the gem from the circlet bathing the Summer Queen in a beautiful orange and gold glow Do you Merla Copperkettle Daughter of the Summer Court accept these gifts Queen Titania Archfey and High Lady of all Seelie Fae asks her I do Mother Merla replies without hesitation Merla feels the magics slam into her binding her tighter than any shackles At the same time the tendrils waiting for her word of consent reach up and dive into her throat She feels a tug and without rhyme or reason she the need to sing out a part of the Song overcomes her As she does the magic grabs her voice and tears If she was standing on her own she would have collapsed but the swirling magic keeps her upright She watches spellbound as the tendrils come back out of her and hold a glowing ball of bright light It floats up to Titania who reaches out and gently takes the glowing orb that echoes with the sound of her voice As she holds it the light shifts morphing into a small shimmering sunflower The binding magics settle and Merla is carefully set back down on her own two feet She feels unsteady but at the same time exhilarated She looks up to Titania who is carefully placing the sunflower in a fold of her regal dress the breastplate she wears protecting it Seeing it Merla wants to reach out and take it back as she feels it calling to her wanting to join its greater part But she stifles that impulse A small piece to give to have the freedom I want to do what I need Titania looks down at her and smiles warmly You have shown you are worthy of my love Merla Continue like you are and there will be more I can give you in time Titania places a gentle hand on her head Merla feels the fey magics seep into her and she closes her eyes in bliss

11670,11670,"I don't love this, but I don't hate it either. I will say that for a stick foundation, this is a fantastic formula. I have dry skin and this glides on easily, doesn't stick to flakes or dry patches, and blends like a dream. Which, if you have dry skin you know that usually isn't the case with stick formulas. The shade is a good match for me. Where I start having problems is with the coverage and finish. This is pretty sheer on me, and layering does make it cake up a little although I can tap the cakiness down pretty well with a damp sponge. It evens out my skintone just enough that I feel ok wearing this on low-makeup days, like running errands. Any blemishes I have are still quite visible. Also this doesn't dry down for me, it just kind of sits on top of my skin and feels sticky/tacky. The finish on me is very glowy and after a couple of hours I look very oiily (again, I have dry skin.) It's basically a tinted moisturizer in stick form, and I keep reaching for it on days when a tinted moisturizer is enough. I don't have many of those days, though, so I don't see myself repurchasing once I've used this up. It's ok, but it's just ok."

4252,4252,Maurice Benard the longtime star of ABC s daytime drama General Hospital Michael Sonny Corinthos Jr is a two time Emmy Award winning film and television actor a member of the prestigious Actors Studio and an advocate for mental health awareness His memoir Nothing General About It How Love and Lithium Saved Me On and Off General Hospital is released April Benard was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at age and has since become a spokesperson for treatment of the disorder with Mental Health America He lives in California with his wife Paula with whom he proudly raised three daughters and a son who is already following in his father s footsteps as an actor Smashing Interviews Magazine Maurice how are you during these strange times Maurice Benard I m good I m good Well you know it s not great But we ve got to get through it right Smashing Interviews Magazine Being bi polar how are you coping with the pandemic Maurice Benard It s more like a family affair now I can tell you that laughs But it s not easy I just talked to someone right now my doctor about anxiety That s what happens during a crisis like this Smashing Interviews Magazine Why did you want to write a memoir at this time in your life Maurice Benard Well it was no particular time Two years ago I decided to write it One thing led to another and here we are which is amazing that in these times my book is coming out Smashing Interviews Magazine You truly had some horrible times in the mental hospital Do you look back now and wonder how you made it through that Maurice Benard Yeah completely I don t know how I made it through except for the grace of God and just putting one foot in front of the other If you stay stagnant you re in trouble so you have to kind of keep moving You know what I mean Smashing Interviews Magazine Yes and that s commendable that you kept going When you were in the hospital you had visions of Jesus and religion seems to have played a part in your life at one time or another Are you or your family religious today Maurice Benard My mom s incredibly religious She s Catholic and so is my dad My brother s not I do believe in God one hundred percent but I just don t follow I don t go to church as much as I would like But I m a Christian I m not Catholic Smashing Interviews Magazine Your mom has been diagnosed as having depression and anxiety Maurice Benard She went to the psychiatrist and I m not sure if she was diagnosed but the beautiful part was that she told me that she didn t want to feel this way anymore Then she started going to the psychiatrist Smashing Interviews Magazine I remember the Sonny Morgan father son bi polar storyline So the disorder is hereditary Maurice Benard Yes I think it is hereditary That s part of what it is from your mother or your father And I can probably say that my mom obviously had some sort of disorder Smashing Interviews Magazine While you were growing up Maurice Benard Yeah But my mom never said anything until actually a year ago when she finally realized it and I believed that she had something Smashing Interviews Magazine After high school you did some modeling and many times modeling transitions into acting But what actually made you really want to become an actor Maurice Benard Modeling wasn t going to happen because I m way too short laughs And even though I lied about my height it wasn t going to happen So the next transition was acting Once I got into acting it seemed to work Not that I was a good actor in the beginning because I wasn t I was actually pretty bad but I knew I had something inside like a passion about it and I wasn t going to give up Smashing Interviews Magazine Maurice I ve been a fan of those dimples since you played Nico Kelly on All My Children in the late s Maurice Benard laughs Smashing Interviews Magazine That was your first major television role Who took you under their wing and showed you the ropes as an an actor Maurice Benard You know I really didn t have anybody to do that I did that for people on General Hospital But I didn t have anybody on All My Children to take me under their wing I just kind of did it on my own Smashing Interviews Magazine I think you were about to quit acting when the producers of General Hospital called But it still wasn t smooth sailing for you when you joined the cast Maurice Benard Yeah The first few weeks on the show I had another breakdown and it was tough It was very tough I threatened to kill my wife It wasn t it wasn t pretty at all Smashing Interviews Magazine You wrote about Kin Shriner having OCD Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Was he able to help you Maurice Benard No because Kin and I weren t all that close until the last couple of years I didn t even know he had OCD We always make fun of each other on the set and I d make fun of his hair and we d make fun of whatever But I didn t know he had OCD until I went to lunch with him and he told me That s when we became close friends Smashing Interviews Magazine You were right to make fun of his hair by the way Maurice Benard laughs Smashing Interviews Magazine Laura Wright Carly and Steve Burton Jason knew about your bi polar disorder How did they help you Maurice Benard Steve and Laura during my bouts of anxiety or depression or anything have always had my back and that s just the way it has been If I say to them I don t want to talk today they re like cool cool cool They ve just been really great Really great Smashing Interviews Magazine Sonny s bi polar storyline must ve been so emotional for you to do because it really hit home Maurice Benard Yes The bi polar storyline was difficult because it went on too long Then my wife had to call General Hospital and say Cut it I remember one time being on the set and I was hearing mom and dad talking on the set and they weren t there I said I ve got to end this one Smashing Interviews Magazine The voices and the hallucinations must be so frightening What would you say is the worst part of this disorder Maurice Benard I think the worst part is either depression and maybe anxiety that happens and your mind can t stop racing That s probably the worst part I mean look in the the hospital obviously there s nothing worse than being tied down to a bed Smashing Interviews Magazine In your opinion has the stigma of bi polar disorder been reduced over the years Maurice Benard I think it has because I think people know what bi polar is I think mental health has gotten more popular today right Whereas before it was like Oh you ll get over it Just go take a pill and you ll be fine But now I think it s a bit different But there is still a stigma because I don t think mental health is treated as serious as it should be when there s million people all over the world that suffer from mental illness Smashing Interviews Magazine General Hospital just celebrated its th anniversary What are your two top favorite Sonny storylines Maurice Benard My two favorite storylines would be the Alzheimer s storyline that s happening right now which is probably the best acting I ve ever done and probably the AIDS storyline Smashing Interviews Magazine The AIDS storyline featuring characters Stone Cates Michael Sutton and Robin Scorpio Kimberly McCullough Maurice Benard Yeah Smashing Interviews Magazine Max Gail who portrays Sonny s dad Mike Corbin is such a versatile actor and you two share some chemistry Maurice Benard I ve not felt that kind of chemistry in a long time Smashing Interviews Magazine Well the coronavirus pandemic has halted production at General Hospital When were you told to report back to work Maurice Benard April How long do you think it s going to last Smashing Interviews Magazine I m hoping for everyone s sake that it s over in the very near future Is your son still interested in acting Maurice Benard Oh yeah He s still acting It s hard for him since he s only He s at that age where they hire year olds Smashing Interviews Magazine What s coming up for Sonny Maurice Benard Oh whatever you re seeing with Mike you ll see what s coming up laughs It s exciting It s really good I can t wait Smashing Interviews Magazine Is there a story behind Buddy the goat Maurice Benard laughs Buddy the goat is just Buddy the goat That guy s like a dog or something He s not a goat It s amazing I got him when he was little and we bonded and we ve been great together He bit my ear once on Instagram and that was the beginning Smashing Interviews Magazine Is it true that he doesn t like Steve Burton Maurice Benard laughs Maybe he doesn t I don t know That s funny as hell That would be funny as hell if that were true Smashing Interviews Magazine How long have you worked with mental health organizations Maurice Benard I ve been doing that for over years now Whatever they want me to do I ll do That s just the way it s been for years and I won t say No It s very important to me To help them is very important Smashing Interviews Magazine It was so refreshing to read in your book about a true love story that actually means for better or worse What is that special thing you and your wife have that has kept you together through the really bad times of your illness Maurice Benard We both know that we have each other s backs There s a deep love there We ve known each other over years And we re always communicating There s always trust My wife s never let me down Ever Smashing Interviews Magazine What do you want readers to learn from your story Maurice Maurice Benard It s a book about mental health It s a love story about mental health I just want people to know that there s hope and to never give up when it comes to mental illness and when it comes to the person you love Hey that was nice laughs ¬© Smashing Interviews

12922,12922,Favorite AnswerThese dogs are a very smart active working breed that needs a handler with good dog skills These dogs are not recommended for novice owners they are bred for working and they are bred to problem solve and think think things through as well as any dog can They re not content being couch potatoes they are not okay with sitting around all the time no job to do They will become destructive not to be confused with aggressive They will make things to do and keep themselves entertained If kept in the house most of the time no obedience no good bond with the owner handler they can and often do create some fun games as barking digging chewing the furniture your personal items the carpeting the walls They can become very destructive like any active dog breed may do They are not happy with just a quick ten minute walk twice a day then off by themselves they need structure they need training to bring out their wonderful personality These dogs do not need to be trained for security work or police type work which many people believe is their main goal they take to pretty much any discipline which you try to teach them and they tend to learn quickly when you have them focused in My cousin has a Malinois police dog it s also the family pet when he is off duty Charlie watches over the baby as well as the three year old making sure the toddler doesn t wander too far off by himself inside the home as well as out playing in the yard with the older kids When the dogs are introduced to children and Taught to be gentle and to be easy with them they adapt quickly and are very tolerant to the awkwardness of a child just learning to stand and walk I m sure the pulling of the hair pulling themselves up hanging on to the dogs ears must hurt the dog but he takes it and gives buck puppy kisses which make the baby squeal with delight The kids have fallen on dog and he accepts it as accidental never angry never nippy or skittish around the kids Like any breed dog they do need to be introduced to small children and watched when with them for safety sake Stating that any breed of dog is safe would be a lie but the Malinois is very accepting and even protective very much like the German Shepherd dogs are Besides making good family dogs they bond well with their handlers and they enjoy playing hard on top of their normal work Our neighbors dog works the large livestock with their healer he also helps bring in the fowl and is gentle with them never rushing them or putting them into a panic when he is done with his farm work you often find him running alongside the kids when they are trail riding swims in the pond with them and loves chasing the frisbee I never thought this breed would be a good retrieving dog but they are very versatile Aside from a great working dog when the day is done they don t mind curling up next to someone and just relaxing They can be quiet and settled when you want to just sit and chill They don t need a lot of specialized grooming just their coats brushed out making sure nothing is stuck in their fur and it also checks them for any injuries pulls any dead hair out They do blow their coats seasonally much like the shepherds do but going to a professional groomer isn t necessary a couple hours of brushing and a big bag for all the loose coat should be enough They don t need bathing unless they get into something or they are muddy even if totally mud covered we usually wait until they are dry take them outside and brush them out unless they smell bad after Other than blowing their coats grooming is relatively easy check their ears nails and checking teeth on occasion making sure there are no problems going on in their mouths

Her ATK and DEF are no comparison to Midori's, but Spendthrift helps with both of those so shoring up the weak spots is more important. Had to do a lot of SP grinding without merges to feed her, but for some reason we're still getting 2x SP today even though it's Tuesday, no idea why but I'm not complaining Very nice!

IT BEGINS: Orange County, Sacramento and El Dorado County Sheriffs Will Not Enforce Gavin Newsom's Curfew Order Gavin Newsom California Governor Gavin Newsom (D) on Thursday issued a curfew for most California counties. The curfew will affect 41 out of 58 counties in California currently in the most restrictive ‚Äúpurple tier.‚Äù Earlier this week Newsom said he was looking at studies from other , Saudi Arabia, where they behead women in public. The 41 counties in the purple tiers will be under a curfew which will be in effect from 10 PM to 5 AM starting on Saturday, November 21 until December 21st. However there is just one problem for the Democrat tyrant currently occupying the governor‚Äôs seat in California. Sheriff‚Äôs offices from Orange County, El Dorado County and Sacramento will not enforce Newsom‚Äôs curfew order. I don't understand what a late night curfew is supposed to due to fight the virus--less people travel at night, meaning its the best time to get errands run if you are trying to socially distance. The curfew is a power grab------good on law enforcement. Duh, the virus sleeps during those hours."

Lately I've been having the Haagen Daz sticks and, having munched this one, I have to say that Magnums are far superior. The white chocolate was sweet and creamy and much thicker than the chocolate on a Haagen Daz one. There were also plenty of almonds. The honey ice cream was delicious and wasn't too sweet or overpowering and worked so well with the sweet, milky white chocolate. Almond and mint Magnums will always be my favourite two, but these definitely make complete my top 3. Delicious.

11461,11461,b Kunstler Forecast What Could Go Wrong b By James Howard Kunstler January b Markets b If you take your cues from Consensus Trance Central the cable news networks i The New York Times WashPost and HuffPo i Trump is all that ails this foundering empire Well Trump i and i Russia since the Golden Golem of Greatness is in league with Vladimir Putin to loot the world or something like that Since I believe that the financial system is at the heart of today s meta question What Could Go Wrong it would be perhaps more to the point to ask what has held this matrix of rackets together so long After all rackets are characterized by pervasive lying and fraud meaning their operations don t add up Things that don t comport with reality are generally prone to failure so sooner or later they have to implode Financial markets have been surging supernaturally on liquidity since and by liquidity I mean money digital credit from thin air supplied by the Federal Reserve in rotation with the other sovereign central banks BOE ECB BOJ PBOC from whence it pings round the world wherever the lure of the main chance sparkles Trillions wafted into the stock and bond markets levitating them as a sort of stage managed misdirection from the sickening spectacle of wobbling i real stuff i economies In The Dow Jones Industrial Average recorded an astounding point year on year upzoom with months of gains and no loser months and a string of record highs America s central bank the Federal Reserve acted as if pumping up the stock markets was the only thing that mattered The result was a Potemkin economy a glittering Wall Street false front with a landscape of flyover squalor and desolation behind The Fed now works at cross purposes with itself by raising the Fed Funds rate a quarter point every few months and supposedly shrinking ha their balance sheet dumping bonds onto the market plus retiring termed out bonds which allows the Fed to i disappear i the principal paid by the borrowers namely the US Treasury or the quasi governmental werewolf called Freddie Mac The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation which bundles all kinds of janky mortgages into giant bonds the Fed buys in order to artificially pump up the real estate market Did your eyes glaze over yet That s the great thing about finance it s bewildering so that when shit goes wrong nobody notices until its way too late What could go wrong with that program Well if you dump billions of bonds on the market you will change the supply and demand equation in the direction of too much supply and interest rates will have to rise when there isn t enough bid from the demand side especially if the US Treasury is creating ever more new bonds to make up for ever greater deficit spending at the same time the Fed dumps bonds into the market And if for instance the interest rate on the benchmark year US Treasury bond goes up past percent well that may be all she wrote for the US government s ability to service its monstrous debt And it may be tits up for the real estate sector too because mortgage rates will rise and fewer people will buy houses The Fed s latest actions boil down to a lame attempt to have some maneuvering room to once again lower interest rates and refill their balance sheet via a QE orgy when the economy heads south in a way that even the US Bureau of Labor Statistics can t obfuscate The ECB and the BOJ have already made noises about curtailing their vacuuming up of securities so the liquidity rotation may end altogether The new Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has at its centerpiece the lowering of corporate income tax from to percent The hidden agenda may be to hope this can act as a substitute for the dwindling central bank liquidity injections The tax cuts and other new gimmicks would increase the federal debt by at least trillion over a ten year period and by unofficial estimates probably much more paving the road to national bankruptcy with good intentions But of course quite a few wise men in this culture have declared that deficits don t matter My own view is that they don t matter until they do and then you re pretty screwed In the background of all this is an array of perilous real world events playing out that include especially potential conflict around North Korea and the Middle East China s banking system is a fun house of scams and dodges that don t add up anymore than ours do The whole wicked pottage of EU Brexit issues simmers away along with the EU s fatal flaw of lacking any fiscal discipline among member nations so government spending has no relation to sovereign borrowing NATO s aggressive military posturing on Russia s borders is pointless stupid dishonest and provocative Nobody knows what kind of gambit Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia will try next Iran demands to be recognized as i the i regional hegemon And our dear exceptional nation with its restless Deep State black box assets is capable of all sorts of mischief at home and abroad Any of these things could shove American markets into criticality as if they don t have enough built in fragility already Manipulation of the markets by the Fed and its water carrying Too Big To Fail partners have deprived the markets of their chief function i price discovery i the ability to discern what things are really worth Markets are therefore functionally useless and their uselessness is a giant hazard No society that depends on money can work for long if nobody knows the true value of things including the value of money itself The price of attempting to live in a culture of pervasive dishonesty is that a re set is inevitable When it happens it will be hugely destabilizing I expect the DJIA to move down sharply before the third quarter rebound a little and eventually bottom at or lower by this time next year I ll call the S P to settle in under The NASDAQ may be the weakest since its FAANG members Facebook Amazon Apple Netflix Google aka Alphabet are among the most mis valued stocks and the most based on vaporous products and services Call NASDAQ to land at Calling for a US dollar index DXY of by December Calling for gold and silver twelve months from now There it is like so much meat on the table Bitcoin and other cryptos have a superficial appeal as a wealth safe haven supposedly out of reach of avaricious governments if you don t consider everything else that s wrong with it Yesterday Dec Australia s biggest banks froze the accounts of Bitcoin investors I think the safe haven idea will prove fallacious Governments are already finding ways to interfere using taxation schemes and shutting down exchanges Bitcoin s other claims on moneyness look bogus as well It s too unstable to be a medium of exchange and too difficult to even access when need to sell and you certainly can t price anything in it as it shoots up and crashes every day Bitcoin went way up because people or maybe just algorithms saw it going way up so they hitched a ride The rush to the exits will be brutal Its final resting place will be zero but perhaps not without a trip or two to nosebleed levels in especially as other markets wobble in the first half of the year Bitcoin K wouldn t surprise me But I m not among the buyers Enjoy the show is the year that fragilities in the shale oil industry challenge the narrative of the miracle The industry hasn t made a net red cent since it ramped up ten years ago It s been running on debt a lot of it junk financing high yield high risk covenant lite The producers have been fracking and pumping all out for several years to maximize their cash flow to service their loans But these shale wells deplete by percent on average after the first three years and have to be replaced by expensive new wells which require ever more debt financing The truth is that shale oil and other unconventional oils just don t pencil out economically Their success in recent years was part and parcel with the central bank credit flood As that credit flow gets choked down in oil companies will go out of business at an impressive rate If the price of oil goes up to a barrel as a result it will be very damaging to what remains of the US economy of real stuff b US Politics b Donald Trump survived in office a whole year Imagine that After the election I figured that the top military brass would give him the bum s rush inside of three months in short a coup d √©tat Their action actually has been much more subtle they just ring fenced him with generals Since he seems to regard them as his generals my generals then he s apparently okay with that like a boy in the nursery with his toy soldiers And apart from the fact that the constitution calls for civilian control of the military and not vice versa I m okay with that for now He s got chaperones at least This is admittedly not the ideal disposition of American political power I did not vote for the Golden Golem and I don t esteem his abilities but the incessant and rather hysterical attacks on his legitimacy especially by members of Consensus Trance Central display a mendacity out of George Orwell s direst dreams I never believed in the ludicrous Russian collusion fantasy and find it difficult to believe that the editors of i The New York Times i do So far Special Counsel Robert Mueller has indicted two high profile grifters Manafort and Gates on financial shenanigans involving business dealings in Russia dating from years before the election plus one National Security Advisor Michael Flynn for speaking with the Russian Ambassador who exactly are foreign ambassadors supposed to speak to if not government officials And otherwise what are they here for and one entry level foreign policy wonk George Papadopoulos who never even met Trump I believe the grave and solemn Mueller is on a fishing expedition Aficionados of DOJ tactics know that prosecutors can always fetch up the proverbial ham sandwich to indict if there s nothing else at hand Then there is the very troubling behavior of FBI employees Peter Strzok Lisa Page Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe plus some members of Obama s inner circle Susan Rice Samantha powers in the twilight months of his term And remember Robert Mueller has been the erstwhile James Comey s mentor and true blue friend going way back It just looks flat out like a bunch of Deep State lifers are out to get the Golden Golem The so called optics are terrible Since crashing stock markets are liable to turn Trump into a mad bull at the same time that Mueller will have to put up or shut up I predict that long about the vernal equinox Mueller will come up with some Mickey Mouse charges against Trump or his people and be promptly fired by the president General Flynn and the baby foreign policy wonk will be pardoned and perhaps others Probably not Manafort and his chum though their prosecution might fail Democrats will go apeshit and batshit both with talk of impeachment and constitutional crisis but I don t think any of that will stick Congress may have more to worry about with tanking markets and other symptoms of an incipient economic train wreck The effort to dump Trump would aggravate the tanking markets It is also plausible after the disclosures of recent months that the Russian meddling investigation could blow back on Hillary the Clinton Foundation Clinton allies and possibly even some of Obama s people maybe even the former president himself The evidence for Obama era FBI involvement in the Christopher Steele file is already out there There is yet to be a satisfactory elucidation of the Loretta Lynch Bill Clinton Phoenix tarmac meet up nor to the circumstances around HRC s lost emails and private server nor the Anthony Weiner laptop nor to the Uranium One matter The casual observer sees much more circumstantial criminality in these matters so far than any Trump collusion with Russia hypothesis provides I venture to predict that ex DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigns her House seat in disgrace as the case of her Pakistani grifter IT aide Imran Awan moves into the courts Trump firing Mueller will drive his Dem Prog adversaries to new heights of hysteria but their wrath may be so ineffectual that they will fall back on their stock in trade ginning up more sexual panic This calls into question the pathetic state of the Democratic Party leadership It s so sclerotic these days that it makes the Whigs of look dynamic They have no program for the compound emergencies the nation faces The party machinery is in the hands of bought and paid for errand boys gender crybabies and race hustlers Their allies at i The New York Times i and CNN look ever more ridiculous peddling daily paranoid fantasies and styling themselves as advocates for the Resistance Their cadres in the Ivy League outposts have turned into the most shamelessly i illiberal i gang of intellectual despots since Mao s Red Guard roamed the earth I m not persuaded that the Dems will necessarily stomp Trump s Republicans in the congressional and state races as seems to be widely assumed for the moment I ll predict rather that in we get the first stirrings of a new party forming to battle both tired old clubs Trump now owns the fate of the stock market and the economy it wags having bragged on it all year He and the Republicans will be blamed if it falls out of bed But my gut feeling is that the voters are even more sick of the Democrats and their victim mongering Their coffers are empty despite jumping through every hoop that Wall Street held out for them Did all the money disappear into the maw of the Clinton Foundation Finally on a personal note I blame them for driving a stake through Garrison s Keillor s heart with their reckless sexual witch hunting and I don t forgive them for that no matter how many tits he may have tried to touch backstage b Elsewhere on This Planet b Economic savant and international man of mystery James Rickards says that Trump and his generals are going to whap North Korea upside its big chunky head soon after the winter Olympics are concluded in South Korea on February But as Trump averred in the election campaign he is not inclined to state in advance exactly what we might do in a military situation Maybe the rumor is true that we have interesting new weapons capable of turning Little Rocket Man into a Post Toastie without harming the mass of innocent North Koreans I d have to give percent odds that whatever we do in Korea turns out to be an epic illustration of Murphy s Law since our track record in foreign military adventures since VJ day in is pretty scant in the win column The Balkan War maybe Bush One s Gulf War sort of Grenada for Godsake what else Kim Jung un may not be able yet to deliver an atomic blast to Rodeo Drive but he can likely lob one into Tokyo on a five minute flight path Look at the map The Japanese must be nervous about it They were once a world class military power in case you don t remember the banzai era Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wants to revise Japan s pacifist constitution engineered by US advisors during the post war occupation to allow for a robust military I wouldn t be surprised if something lethal jumps out of a lacquered black bento box in the direction of Pyongyang around the same time the US goes for that whap upside NK s head And there s Seoul of course less than miles from the DMZ and within range of a supposedly huge array of North Korean heavy artillery The theory is we have a slim window of opportunity to deal with this rascal before he equips himself to do some major mischief in the world I don t believe this is just a bunch of shuck and jive cooked up by the arms merchants and their friends It s real and existential and very messy Something is going to happen there China has a pretty firm mutual defense treaty with North Korea and perhaps reason to want to keep the regime up and running as a buffer zone But do they really want to jump feet first into World War Three defending Kim I guess we ll find out In the meantime China s president Xi Jinping has got enough on his plate trying to safely land the high flying but wobbling debt saturated Chinese economy Odds are that it s going to be a rough landing In which case maybe war is the answer as a way of distracting the Chinese public s attention But what sort of war Cyber sabotage EMP blackouts Good old fashioned mutual nuclear destruction Grinding old school land campaigns Naval battles It s a dangerous game and Xi does not look like a risk junkie more like prudent ole Uncle Xi So I ll predict that whatever blows on the Korean Peninsula China will try to stay out of it even if it makes faces and jumps up and down a bit Russia can only benefit from steering clear of war though its recent offer to act as an intermediary between Kim and Trump was a smart move Maybe they remember how Teddy Roosevelt negotiated a peace settlement in the Russo Japanese War of They have little to lose and prestige to gain Despite what you hear about the unholy thuggery of Vladimir Putin it seems to me that what he wants most of all for his country is to attain the condition of a politically and economically i normal i nation after the year long misadventure with communism I suspect Putin and others in Russia would have liked the country to become more fully Europeanized in tone and style than it has been allowed to be with NATO playing war games on Russia s border and US monkeyshines in Ukraine and sanctions against it for really no good reason So Russia has been shoved back into its cubbyhole as a nation i not quite of Europe i with sinister Byzantine overtones and ancient exotic Mongol influences This quasi isolation has some benefits for Russia for one the imperative to develop businesses and industries for import replacement that is for becoming more self sufficient Russia has a lot to work worth with the world s highest oil production lots of ores and minerals untold hydropower and endless timber It can make its own stuff and Russian citizens are free to try starting businesses The country may even benefit from climate change with expanded croplands Russia is already approaching food self sufficiency after the long catastrophe of soviet farm collectivization Meanwhile Europe desperately needs Russia s oil and natural gas so they must know that using NATO troops and armor to make threats is a hollow gesture Notice that Russia is stockpiling gold reserves where the USA is just selling the stuff off China is stockpiling too Like mad When other currencies implode there is reason to believe the world will be introduced to a gold backed Ruble and Yuan money backed by money They ll be able to buy stuff they need Will we Will a gold backed currency shove aside the US dollar as world reserve currency The precursor to that will be China s effort to establish oil trade in its Yuan Europe has stumbled along economically for several years on Mario Draghi s promise to do whatever it takes to keep the EU s member nations from falling into the black hole of debt deflation namely buying every bond that the sovereign governments and corporations issue That kept the game going but the structural imbalances in EU banking are now so extreme that it is hard to see a way out besides an EU crackup The Merkel led immigration and refugee policy looked like a bad bet from the get go and is liable to get worse when the i whatever it takes i liquidity dries up and the EU member countries fall into recession or depression and there s no more money to pay for all those refugee settlement centers and the social services that have been provided There won t be enough gainful employment for Germans Belgians Frenchmen and Swedes let alone for immigrants and refugees I ll predict that starting in we ll see efforts to ramp up deportations of these newcomers Racist That will be the knee jerk hue and cry But the epithet is losing its punch as the effects of Merkel s open door policy are felt on the ground in the obvious hostility xenophobia and aggression displayed by Islamic settlers The defeat of ISIS on the Middle East battlefields in suggests that they will be ramping up terror operations to Europe European nationalism movements will grow in and gain intellectual respectability as the defense of European culture is taken seriously Middle European states such as Hungary and Poland have not given in on the EU s demand to accept immigrants and refugees from Islamic lands Their example will be followed Politicians in the rest of Europe will consider the Just Say No option The United Kingdom enters especially vulnerable to economic travail The estimated cost of Brexit at tens of billions of pounds sterling and the potential loss of business especially banking is one mighty headwind The other less talked about is the dwindling of the UK s oil and gas reserves The equation is simple fewer energy inputs equals lower economic activity The only way around that is the popular central bank strategy of recent years money printing and accounting fraud You can t base an economy on that and the truth will become painfully self evident this new year in Great Britain Suddenly this last week of anti regime demonstrations are busting out all over Iran They are said to be protests over poor economic performance and the regime s squandering of resources sponsoring mischief in other lands Yemen Syria Lebanon etc Folks are getting killed in the streets The Revolutionary Guard the zealots who took our diplomatic personnel hostage in have promised to squash the protest Many Iranians must be good and goddam sick of mullahs and ayatollahs running the joint Otherwise it s beginning to look like Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman MBS of Saudi Arabia KSA would like to rumble with Iran to beat back their influence outside their borders in the region Iran has had plenty of opportunity to play with its military hardware in recent decades in the Iran Iraq War arming Hezbollah to battle Israel in support of Bashar al Assad s government in Syria and lately in Yemen s civil war KSA on the other hand has been buying jet planes and bombs from the US for decades with nary a chance to put them to use MBS seems eager to test drive this schwag A real dust up between the principals would put a lot of the world s oil supply at risk if oil tanker shipping in the Persian Gulf were interrupted China and Japan would bear the brunt but the whole world would feel it Kicking the clerics out of government in Iran might tone down the unnecessary religious hostilities between Sunni and Shiites that has played such a big part in the creation of failed states throughout the Middle East and North Africa MENA Iran has plenty of economic problems inside its own borders The disarray in other areas of the vast MENA region will continue in whether regime change in Iran happens or not Iraq Libya Somalia Sudan are permanently failed states with Egypt ever on the verge Syria will stabilize as a much smaller economy propped up by payments from Russia for hosting naval and air bases there This part of the world has suffered ruinous population overshoot in the industrial age especially the states that produced oil The desert ecology can t support all these people as the industry falters and shrinks Even as the situation worsens the swollen populations will generate more children When they can no longer decant themselves into Europe the real misery starts You may have forgotten there is a place called South America Its many nations have been in a pleasant political coma for a decade or so except Venezuela which is in cardiac arrest organ failure and brain death There will be a bloody revolution there this year and Venezuela s oil industry will be crippled adding to the world s oil supply problems b The Closing of the American Mind b was a spectacular year for intellectual collapse among the political Left but especially for its subsidiaries on campus The trauma of Donald Trump s election victory put this faction into a fugue state in which no opportunity for coercion and persecution of imagined enemies could be missed The victim oppressor politics spawned by the critical theory for lunch bunch has produced an ideology in which inclusion means segregated dorms racially separate graduation ceremonies and at Harvard closing down age old men s and women s voluntary social associations And diversity means as long as you express the exactly same ideas we do The presidents deans and faculty of colleges around the country have turned into the most obdurate enemies of free thought since the Spanish Inquisition a gang of cowards and villains who disgrace the meaning and purpose of higher Ed Highlights of the year in Social Justice Warrior Land include the violence around Charles Murray s lecture at Middlebury the Antifa riots at UC Berkeley the Day of Absence ritual at Evergreen U in Washington State where white people were banished from campus and the Lindsey Shepherd star chamber tribunal at Laurier University in Toronto I know that s outside the USA In all of these cases college presidents deans and faculty acted contemptibly supporting coercion persecution antipathy to due process of law the willful betrayal of common decency and a folio of shockingly stupid ideas such as the proposition from the chair of the Purdue University Engineering Department one Donna Riley that academic rigor is a symptom of white male heterosexual privilege As it happens higher education is approaching its own state of implosion since college has become most of all a money grubbing racket tuned to the flow of exorbitant student loans for exorbitant college costs Higher Ed s fate is tied to the financial sector especially the bond market since college loans are lately being bundled into janky bonds just like the NINJA mortgages of were The entire US college industry has been in a hypertrophic blow off for decades and the gross expansion of facilities programs and costs has developedan inverse relationship to the value of a college education I predict that a shocking number of small four year colleges will go out of business this year Students who had not completed their degree requirements will just be shit out of luck b Concluding Thoughts b will be a tumultuous year of shake outs and loss The watchword for the year should be lean Individuals will be shoved into leaner modes of living Companies will suffer despite the new lower tax Financial rewards will be lean Nations will have to seriously start planning to get by on less to downscale and jettison programs that don t jibe with the mandates of reality is the year that the world comes un stuck from the past ten years of pretending that it s possible to get something for nothing For it s full speed ahead into

7626,7626,This week s prize goes to John Tng not only for this post but in recognition of running a website that promotes heresy divination numerology date setting Scriture twisting superstition false teaching false prophets and all sorts of abominations NOTE The chapter and verse numbers in the Bible are NOT inspired but then try and tell that to these crackpots The Hidden Rapture in Psalm According to the Hidden Prophecies in the Psalms discovered by J R Church the year is hidden in Psalm I believe I have discovered the rapture hidden in this psalm I will not attempt to speculate on a specific day although the probability of the rapture falling on a Jewish feast day is always higher than a non feast day given that Jesus fulfilled the spring feast days in His First Coming The Rapture Word We begin by inspecting a piece of inconspicuous evidence hidden in Psalm It is found in verse when the psalmist cried out to God to deliver his soul The word deliver is translated from the Hebrew word natsal which means to escape or to be snatched away Natsal is like the rapture in the Hebrew language Christians are more familiar with its Greek equivalent harpazo which means to be caught up taken by force as found in the famous rapture verse in Th Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord Natsal is not as well known as harpazo as far as the rapture goes However the idea of a natsal escape or removal by force can be established with very strong scriptural types in the Old Testament In Amos we read I have overthrown some of you as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning yet have ye not returned unto me saith the LORD The phrase plucked out is translated from the Hebrew word natsal That was what happened when the angel removed Lot and family by force before fire and brimstone rained down from heaven and destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah Gen Likewise Christians will be removed at the rapture prior to sudden destruction when judgment falls upon the unsuspecting world The Hebrew word natsal appears a total of times in the book of Psalms alone It appears for the th time in Psalm the hidden prophecy psalm pointing to the year After this appearance the next appearance occurs psalms further down the book at Psalm the hidden prophecy psalm pointing to the year This big gap of years between the two psalms that contain the word natsal gives us a hint that our deliverance will more likely take place in the year rather than the year twenty two years later simply because given the world shaking events that are going on right now it is hard to imagine how much longer this world will last The year is just too distant for the rapture to happen Before the natsal in Psalm another occurrence just before it in Psalm verse seems to shout out that something significant is coming our way The Hebrew gematria of natsal is also the same as the verse number in Psalm Is God drawing our attention to what is going to happen this year Ps natsal gematria >> alert >> Ps natsal gematria The fact that the word natsal can be found in Psalm is inconclusive of the rapture happening in the year in view of its many occurrences in other psalms However there are other compelling evidence in Psalm The Rapture the Antichrist and the Tribulation The rapture takes place just prior to the tribulation when all hell breaks loose When reading Psalm does the reader get a sense that this psalm is describing the end times From the verses are we able to detect the veiled presence of the Antichrist who is yet to be revealed Bear in mind the Antichrist will come out like a roaring lion ready to devour believers when the final curtain falls Right now he is waiting in the wings biding his time Psalm is a short psalm with verses jam packed with amazing hidden clues In my distress I cried unto the LORD and he heard me Deliver natsal my soul O LORD from lying lips and from a deceitful tongue What shall be given unto thee or what shall be done unto thee thou false tongue Sharp arrows of the mighty with coals of juniper Woe is me that I sojourn in Mesech that I dwell in the tents of Kedar My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace I am for peace but when I speak they are for war Without trying too hard even a cursory reading of this psalm tells us that the psalmist wants to get out of the depressing situation he is in appealing to God to deliver him from distress woe and war Are we not in the same depressing situation now Satan and his right hand man are both number one liars Jesus describes the devil in John Ye are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father ye will do He was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him When he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it In Psalm the psalmist cried to God to deliver natsal him from lying lips verse a deceitful tongue verse and false tongue verse These descriptors triangulate on the Antichrist a liar who takes after his father the devil The first Hebrew word at the opening of Psalm is tsarah translated as distress in the KJV It is translated as tribulation three times elsewhere in the Old Testament The first time tsarah actually its root word tsar is translated as tribulation it refers to the latter days that is the end times This is the scripture here When thou art in tribulation and all these things are come upon thee even in the latter days if thou turn to the LORD thy God and shalt be obedient unto his voice Deu Thus Psalm sets the opening scene at the time of tribulation in the latter days when the Antichrist is raring to step into his role The believer represented by the psalmist at the start of Psalm finds himself in a distressing situation not unlike in a pandemic aka Covid currently ravaging the world Furthermore the believer is asking God to deliver natsal him from the Antichrist and from the distress he is in Bit by bit we are seeing mounting evidence of the rapture hidden in Psalm As we read further more and more confirmations will emerge from the verses that follow In verse of Psalm we read Sharp arrows of the mighty with coals of juniper This immediately jolted my memory to what happened during the Gulf Wars in when Scud missiles were fired at Israel by the Iraqi army I wrote about this hidden prophecy in Psalm more than twenty two years ago long before it became more widely known in Christian forums see The reference to these devastating missiles is couched in less deadly metaphor by the psalmist as the arrow that flieth by day in Psalm verse These missiles if fitted with nuclear warhead are weapons of mass destruction Psalm seems to point to a nuclear war in It can happen either prior to the natsal deliverance of believers or shortly after As with the arrow that flieth by day of Psalm here in Psalm the sharp arrows of the mighty may suggest some kind of missiles fired with hint that they may be nuclear judging from the second part of verse with coals of juniper see proof near the end of this post Given the current geopolitical situations in the Middle East and the world this scenario is not that far fetched Reading on verse further intimates that this war may well be the Ezekiel war Woe is me that I sojourn in Mesech that I dwell in the tents of Kedar One of the nations that will attack Israel in the Ezekiel war is Meshech Eze The psalmist seems to clue us in to the Ezekiel war by mentioning his sojourning in Meshech one of the attacking nations The Ezekiel war is the most anticipated event next on the prophetic calendar Many scholars believe it is the sudden destruction just prior to or immediately after the rapture For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night For when they shall say Peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape Th By the time the reader finishes reading Psalm the idea that the rapture is hidden in this psalm appears very compelling The thief in the night snatching away of believers will happen in the midst of war and peace wars and rumors of wars This uneasy state of war and peace is very thinly veiled in the ending verses of Psalm My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace I am for peace but when I speak they are for war Thus amazingly the entire psalm conceals the rapture of the saints at a time when the world is in great turmoil mired in economic woes wars and rumors of wars when evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived Tim Psalm fits the rapture scenario to a T The Rapture the Bride One very strong hidden evidence in Psalms supports the idea that the psalmist represents the bride of Christ the body of believers who will be raptured Only two scriptures in the Bible contain the phrase the tents of Kedar Psalm and Song The second scripture clearly points to the bride of Christ typified by the main character in the book of Song of Solomon known as the Shulamite the bride I am black but comely O ye daughters of Jerusalem as the tents of Kedar as the curtains of Solomon Song But the more intriguing hidden gem is found in the phrase the tents of Kedar First note that Kedar is the second son of Ishmael his name means dark or black So here we see a direct link to the Shulamite bride who is described in verse as black but comely a black beauty if you will Second a deeper and more profound meaning hidden in the tents of Kedar lies in the fabric that goes into the making of the tents These tents were made from black goat hair the same fabric that was used to make one of the curtains that covers the Tabernacle in the wilderness Exo It is no wonder that the psalmist equates the tents of Kedar to the curtains of Solomon in Song reminding us that King Solomon s Temple is an upgraded version of the Tabernacle built by his father King David I think you can see where this is leading According to the writer of Song of Solomon the Shulamite bride is likened to a tent a curtain a covering As Christians we know this amazing fact spiritually the church is an organic part of the Tabernacle the vital body or vessel or covering that conceals the glory of the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies the two sacred rooms in the Tabernacle This is only possible because the bride of Christ is the body of Christ and the temple of the Holy Spirit Without a doubt the bride of Christ is hidden in plain sight in Psalm The Rapture the Song of Ascents Next I want to consider another piece of evidence that is no less compelling Psalm is not just another psalm It is the first in a series of psalms collectively known as the Song of Ascents or the Psalm of Ascents from Psalm to Psalm These songs were sung by the Jews during their pilgrimage to Jerusalem to present themselves before God at the three annual feasts of Israel In Psalm the psalmist expressed his longing to return to Jerusalem so that he be far from the oppressive company of evil doers The sojourning psalmist reminds us of this well known Christian song This World is Not My Home It sums up perfectly the longing of the to be raptured bride of Christ This world is not my home I am just a passing through My treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue The angels beckon me from heaven s open door And I can not feel at home in this world anymore Oh lord you know I have no friend like you If heaven s not my home then lord what will I do The angels beckon me from heaven s open door And I can not feel at home in this world anymore In Psalm the believer sojourning in Meshech the world could not wait to return to Jerusalem to worship God to part company with those who hate peace and are for war and with those who delight in spreading falsehoods and lies The sojourner of Psalm in the midst of distress and tribulation cries out to God to deliver him from evil and from evil men The title or superscription of these psalms Song of the Ascents is remarkable for three reasons First the pilgrims of old who lived in the surrounding cities and villages three times annually journeyed up to Jerusalem that sits atop the mountain So the pilgrims were ascending from a lower plane to a higher ground Second the ancient Levite singers stood around the foot of a step semi circular stairway located at the Court of the Women leading up into the entrance of the raised inner court the Court of Israel With songs and musical instruments the Levite singers would sing these psalms Only the priests and Levites were permitted to ascend these steps to enter into the inner court Third these psalms were sung starting in a low tone of voice and steadily ascending to a higher one Why this multiple emphasis on ascending The imagery of journeying up the mountain or going up the staircase or singing with ascending tone are all calculated to point to one thing the ascending of the saints at the rapture to meet God in heaven and to worship Him in the New Jerusalem This upward theme is encapsulated in the Ascents part of the title of the Psalms of Ascents Psalm the hidden prophecy psalm pointing to the rapture in year is itself intriguing because of the number More can be said about the number and its link to the number the number of psalms in the Psalms of Ascents Suffice for now to note that if we were to add all numbers from to the sum is Perhaps this is why Psalm is the first in the series of these Psalms of Ascents The number is no ordinary number in the New Testament There were believers in the upper room when the Holy Spirit descended on the first Pentecost Is it now time for the Holy Spirit to reverse the descension and to ascend together with the bride of Christ at the rapture after nearly years of grace We do not have to wait too long to find that out The Raptured Saint Our second last piece of hidden evidence should thrill all believers who are waiting for the appearing of Jesus In Psalm verse we find this cryptic clue coals of juniper Juniper is a desert shrub Why did the psalmist mention this desert plant in verse right after the phrase sharp arrows of the mighty They seem incongruent Earlier we made this connection between sharp arrows and missiles furthermore we surmised that the reference on coals could imply nuclear explosion However there is more to the phrase coals of juniper than meets the eye The Hebrew word for juniper appears only four times in the Old Testament It last appears in Psalm the rapture psalm The word juniper first appears two times in quick succession in Kings chapter verses and This chapter records the story of an Old Testament prophet who was escaping from his enemy who wanted him dead He was definitely in a great distress to put it mildly He went on a day s journey into the wilderness and came to rest under the shade of a juniper tree He cried out to God to take away his life for he had had enough This looks very much like the distressing scenario in Psalm But the kicker is this this Old Testament prophet is none other than Elijah the only other saint besides Enoch who bypassed death and entered straight into heaven alive If this is not a rapture clue I do not know what is But there is more Poor Elijah must have been so exhausted physically and mentally that he fell asleep under the juniper tree The angel of the Lord some scholars think he was Jesus appearing in His pre incarnate form came and woke Elijah up touched him and commanded him to arise and eat Arise is a code word for resurrection and rapture think of it like ascending After Elijah ate the bread and drank the water supernaturally provided by the angel he went on his way without food and water for forty days and forty nights as he journeyed to Horeb the mount of God Any way you cut it the parallel to the rapture is unmistakable In Psalm the psalmist secretly plants phrases like the tents of Kedar and coals of juniper to transmit hidden codes of the bride of Christ and the rapture of the saints in plain sight The Testimony of Hibakujumoku I reserve this piece of evidence last not because it is the most intriguing even though it is but because I found it last Hibakujumoku is A bombed tree in the Japanese language Today there are about trees that survived the atomic bombing of Hiroshima I fell out of my chair when I saw the number the Hebrew gematria of natsal the rapture Did God miraculously preserve these trees and in such a number too to convey a message to watchers like us at a time such as this You decide Hibakujumoku are not just any trees they are hardy trees that can withstand the nuclear blast and still survive It turns out the juniper tree is one such tree The evidence will be shown shortly So our initial suspicion that the coals of juniper is a result of nuclear explosion is proven right According to the Wikipedia article at with source reference Hiroshima and Nagasaki The Physical Medical and Social Effects of the Atomic Bombings published in by Basic Books the effects of the atomic bomb fit the phrase coals of juniper perfectly The degree of damage to trees was quite different by direction At places far from the hypocenter only the side of the tree trunk facing the hypocenter was burned while the opposite side was frequently normal in appearance In some trees there were no branches on the side facing the hypocenter while the other side had many branches Damage to plants was found only in the portions exposed above ground and portions underground were not directly damaged Consequently the root and the underground stalk put forth new buds even in those whose above ground portion was completely burned In some hibaku trees were charred like coals and burned above ground seconds after the detonation of the atomic bomb in Hiroshima and survived Today these trees are regenerated and continue to live species of Hibakujumoku that survived are documented in the UNITAR database out of these one species has the name juniper in it Pyramid juniper Juniperus chinensis Kaizuka The evidence that the juniper tree can survive a nuclear explosion and became charred like coal is well documented in the literature Our initial hunch has been vindicated The Hebrew word for bride is kallah its gematria is The conclusion is the phrase coals of juniper not only confirms that Psalm intimates a nuclear war in the Middle East today the supernatural preservation and regeneration of the species of A bombed trees totaling testifies to the coming natsal gematria rapture of the kallah gematria bride in the year Doves we are living in exciting times Get excited The rapture is coming soon If this is not the year take heart that we are one year closer May the Spirit and the bride say Come Lord Jesus John Tng

Yelich has ascended to true superstar status thanks to a slight alteration to his swing to create more fly balls coupled with the move to a more hitter friendly ballpark down in the Menomonee Valley Yelich captured the National League s Most Valuable Player award in after winning the batting title and finishing with a wRC+ home runs and steals The pundits spoke of regression heading into and Yelich used that as motivation to somehow become even better this past season He won his second straight batting title after improving his average to 329 and also led the league in on base percentage slugging and naturally OPS Yelich shaved a hair off his strikeout rate from to He improved his walk rate by more than three points up to including a major jump in intentional walks from two to In Yelich finished second in the NL with a 272 ISO In his 342 ISO led the Senior Circuit by points He finished in the league s th percentile in average exit velocity the th percentile in hard contact rate and the th percentile in expected weighted on base average Despite being limited to games and plate appearances after a freak knee injury on a foul ball ended his season in mid September Yelich set a new career high with home runs eight more than the previous career high that he achieved the year before He even became more valuable on the basepaths stealing bases at a success rate while adding baserunning runs above average up from BsR in His Sprint Speed ranked in the league s th percentile Yelich s defense isn t a weakness per se however other personnel moves made by the team during this past offseason will allow Craig Counsell to regularly line up the superstar in his best spot on the grass Christian was the team s primary right fielder during the last two seasons while veteran Ryan Braun patrolled left field and Yelich graded out as merely average during that time according to the metrics He accrued Defensive Runs Saved Ultimate Zone Runs and Fielding Runs Above Average in a little over innings in right during his first two seasons in Brewers blue but the addition of Avisail Garcia will move Christian back across the outfield to playing left on an everyday basis Yelich won a Gold Glove in left for the Marlins in and has been valued at DRS there over the course of his career The injury wound up costing Yelich a second straight MVP award as he finished second to Cody Bellinger of the Los Angeles Dodgers though as our David Gibson explored recently there are plenty of reasons to dispute that decision Now fully healthy Yelich should be an anchor in the lineup once again whenever baseball does begin in and for several years beyond that after agreeing to an extension that ensures he ll be suiting up for the Milwaukee Nine through at least With deferrals Yelich won t make more than mil any given season Sure that means he ll be getting paid by the organization through but still Yelich may be a California kid who was transplanted to the Midwest through no choice of his own yet he feels so much at home here that he decided to give Milwaukee about as big a hometown discount as you ll see in the game today On the days when Yelich isn t manning left field and he s been somewhat prone to missed time in the last two years dealing with off and on back issues dating back to his Marlins days in addition to the knee injury Braun will likely be the man to see those plate appearances Counsell s personnel is likely to lead to plenty of rotations around the diamond Braun occasionally spelling Yelich in left and Garcia in right in addition to his duties at first base Garcia giving Lorenzo Cain breaks in center field and depending on how the roster shakes out perhaps Ben Gamel serving as the fifth outfielder across all positions Utilityman Brock Holt could also see some spot starts in the grass too if necessary In the MinorsUnlike most other positions around the diamond outfield is actually a spot where the Brewers possess solid depth throughout the organization man outfield Tyrone Taylor got a brief look at the end of last season and has been solid in Triple A the last two years There was a reunion with old friend Keon Broxton to provide another veteran presence in Triple A along with Jace Peterson and Andres Blanco Switch hitting Cooper Hummel is coming off something of a breakout campaign in Double A Biloxi and could get a shot at the highest level of the minors And of course former overall draft pick Corey Ray is still hanging around and looking to bounce back after a nightmarish season in Chad Spanberger the trade return for Chase Anderson possesses enviable raw power grades and is capable of playing the outfield corners Top prospect Tristen Lutz should get his first opportunity to make the jump to Double A MiLB free agent signee Alexander Palma is interesting Further on down the ladder are guys worth paying attention to like Carlos Rodriguez Joe Gray Thomas Dillard Pablo Abreu and Micah Bello And even farther into the future are the highly touted players who have been part of Milwaukee s strong international classes such as Eduarqui Fernandez Luis Medina and Hedbert Perez Statistics

When people see something different, something they're not used to, they generally say something. It's interesting, because if it was normal brown, like it is naturally, then people don't say something. I've had a lot of people say something, because they like it and are simply too afraid to do it themselves. They call me ""brave"" for doing it. I partly disagree. I think it has to be something you really want. I've wanted blue hair since I was 8 years old. I couldn't wait to dye it when I left school. I don't really care what other people think, because it was something I wanted. But it got me thinking, what is your opinion on dyed hair? And be completely honest because I really don't mind üòÇ What is your natural hair colour? And what is your favourite hair colour on other people? I've always loved my brown hair, don't get me wrong! I just wanted to have blue hair for a while, and I still do. I love brown hair. But I can appreciate every hair colour. I think it just has to match YOU. ‚Ä¢ So let's talk about hair, let me know your thoughts below ‚ú® ‚Ä¢ I took these photos a while back and couldn't quite get a ""perfect"" one, but I liked these and couldn't pick a favourite, so here's all 3 of them üòÇüíû . . . . ."

OP, if you plan on lifting it, skip the 1/2 ton & go 3/4. Cheaper lifts, easier to do, no parts to wear quickly like the 1/2 tons (ball joints, TREs, CV axles) because of increased stress of higher angles & tires. Then the added cost of regearing a IFS differential. A 2‚Äù spacer on a 3/4 ton is the cheapest lift at around $75, and you can fit 35‚Äùs. I agree on the Big Horn being best bang, though I would‚Äôve bought a Sport if it was available in ‚Äò14 for the 3/4‚Äôs. But I found paintable parts and made my own. So far they have never given me a problem. more than likely its because they use them wrong. they are must have on a 4x4 pickup. In my opinion."

still in bed he has a meeting and does not have to be up until I drag myself to my closet and decide what to wear in under a minute this is unprecedented brush my teeth and hair realize it looks insane because I slept with it up and pull out the curling iron I do my makeup mascara eyebrow pencil and gel a m I put on the kettle for tea grab a blender cup and toss in frozen berries a frozen banana coconut milk and ginger kombucha Not gonna lie I am slightly hungover and need literally anything in my stomach I pack up my tea and the smoothie once they are ready and trudge out the door a m My stomach still feels subpar I eat a few pieces of Trader Joe s dried mango and refill my water I contemplate how much time I need to finish the project I have due at tomorrow I think I can put it off until after lunch p m I head home for lunch One of the perks of working two miles from home is I can leave the office every day so I remember what the sun looks like plus I am never tempted to eat out My Sunday Scaries order has arrived which reminds me to take a few deep breaths for my always there anxiety I reheat the Trader Joe s tamales that I made last night then pound a bunch of water and lie on the couch for five minutes checking Instagram before dragging myself back out into the real world p m FREEDOM I contemplate driving to Aldi s but do not feel like spending money so I go home instead and proceed to watch as much Jane the Virgin as I can sneak in before N comes home and wants to watch something together p m N is home but our neighbor immediately greets him in the driveway with a can of beer so he stays out there chatting We got lucky and get along really well with all of our neighbors which is awesome since we did not know anyone in our old neighborhood In the meantime more Jane the Virgin for me Three beers later N is finally done chatting and comes into the house Bye bye Jane We are hungry and settle on Trader Joe s mandarin chicken for dinner so I toss the chicken in to bake and stir fry some broccoli and green beans to go with it N cleans the kitchen while I do this We have gotten into a LOT of fights about chores so this feels like a major win p m Dishes cleaned we plop on the couch and continue watching the new season of Mindhunter N loves this show I think it s good but it creeps me out a lot I pull out a coloring book and work on that for a while to distract myself and then mess around on my phone looking at the Mint budget app I am obsessed with tracking my finances but somehow still spend too much a m Okay so it turns out I can not sleep I get up and write out my thoughts while debating the pros of insomnia being sort of productive versus the cons literally tired all of the time also I hate coffee and am very sensitive to caffeine Daily Total Day Three a m I did not fall asleep until somewhere around so I am not feeling like the best version of myself Fortunately I have a doctor s appointment this morning so I am working from home until Maybe it ll look more convincing if I fire off a couple emails My hair still looks okay from curling it yesterday so I touch it up in an attempt to feel like my life is more put together than it is a m I started taking an SSRI at the beginning of the year for anxiety and depression and my doctor decided to up the dose a few months ago which has resulted in some unfortunate side effects weird amount of sweating insomnia restless legs which led to more anxiety so I scheduled this appointment to talk to her about my options We decide I should try a different SSRI that is supposed to affect sleep less Fingers crossed My copay is p m I get out of a long meeting and head home for lunch I have no idea what I am going to eat but I have not eaten anything today and I am HUNGRY I end up settling on a Trader Joe s turkey burger with green goddess dressing and goat cheese wrapped in lettuce It s very messy and the burger is still a bit disappointing so I put some mayo on the second half No burger is complete without mayo Then I eat a plum to feel slightly healthier p m Finally home I feel like a dead body but at least my hair looks amazing N is here already ripping apart the house with his coworker B p m Apparently N told B about our margarita machine so I get sent out for supplies I run down the street and pick up two bottles of margarita mix a bottle of tequila and a bottle of wine my reward since I have been informed B is staying for dinner and I will probably have to go pick that up as well This comes out to around N pays p m The guys are getting hungry so I order a pizza we get a large with roasted garlic whipped ricotta and arugula which as predicted I am sent to pick up minutes later N pays for this as well I make a salad to go with the pizza and eat with the guys our neighbor winds up coming over too though he just has a margarita and then go back into the bedroom to watch Jane the Virgin while the guys talk shop p m Everyone has left and we settle in to watch some Mindhunter before heading to bed Here s hoping that I can sleep tonight Daily Total Day Four a m Well I woke up an hour ago and despite my best efforts my brain will not shut off I head out to the couch so I do not wake N up take some CBD and type this up Yes I know you are not supposed to look at screens when you are trying to sleep but in my personal experience it does not matter what kind of light I am looking at they all keep me up Also I use an app called Flux that adjusts the light from my screen so I use Darkroom mode On the plus side I got paid today so I will update my budget spreadsheet a m I do my bills Venmo N for rent I do this once a week the total for the month is included in my monthly expenses and pay toward one of my credit cards I have about in credit card debt that I am slowly chipping away at Normally I pay more than this but my car loan payment just went through also included in my monthly expenses Sigh One day I will be able to pay off my credit cards and not live paycheck to paycheck a m I drag myself off the couch to get dressed and ready for work I feel like a zombie but someone else already said they are in late with an ailment and I always feel like it looks suspicious if two people call out I know I am overthinking things but if I am really struggling I will work from home this afternoon I make tea grab a kombucha trudge trudge trudge p m So Tired I decide to head home for lunch so I do not have to look at a screen anymore I am not super hungry for lunch since I have been really bloated all day from the pizza but I heat up some of the spaghetti squash and tomato sauce and eat that with a plum and more tea p m I take a quick shower when I finish working then head out to run errands I go to Aldi s and get olive oil three bags of frozen fruit sunflower seeds three bottles of kombucha avocado ranch dressing garlic Parmesan mozzarella hummus cheddar chia seeds tortilla chips and dark chocolate Then I head over to Market to pick up my prescription which I pay for in cash Finally I pop into BJ s and get gas I head home unpack the groceries and catch up with N who walks in right as I am finishing up p m I drive to my friend L s house to pick her up and we go to our other friend K s house for D D Yes Dungeons Dragons K approached us a while ago asking if we would be interested in playing and recording the game for a podcast he wants to make so we are currently meeting every few weeks with two other people to practice since except for K no one in our group has played before p m We are all ravenous so we get two orders of cheesy bread from Domino s I do not think I have had Domino s since freshman year of college and I am going to regret it in the morning but hunger and exhaustion make for bad decisions L pays I will pay her back at some point later we hang out a lot and do not worry about paying each other back since it always evens out in the end p m We are all exhausted and wrap up the game I drop off L then head home brush my teeth and pass out by N is not home yet he went out and had a guys night since I was out for the evening Daily Total Day Five a m I slept through the night Technically I woke up half an hour ago but that s still a solid eight hours SLEEP IS AMAZING I roll around until my alarm goes off at and then get up and start getting ready for work Make tea grab kombucha and I am out the door at the usual time p m I head home for lunch and make a smoothie with frozen mango peach strawberry pineapple and banana plus a tiny bit of leftover kombucha and coconut milk It s our friend C s birthday today so I pull a couple sticks of butter out of the fridge I want to make cookies for him before we all meet up for dinner tonight I also snack on some chips and hummus since N will probably finish the hummus tonight yes the one I bought yesterday he already ate over half of it p m I leave work and drive home I have to make these cookies for C and I am going to have a glass of wine while I do it and go full homemaker because it s Thursday and I like wine Boom They are amazing I text with my friends while the cookies bake and we decide we want to try press on nails can you say impulse shopping I find a good deal online so I buy them and they Venmo each for theirs p m N and I head out a little early so we can stop at the ATM before dinner We are the first ones at the restaurant so we get a round of drinks including one for the birthday boy N pays including tip We have a large group so all the ladies sit at one end and the guys at the other The ladies split two orders of bruschetta the bread component is actually a slice of fried cheese I am in heaven and L gets some boneless buffalo chicken wings that we all pick at I get an order of fish tacos for my entr√©e and two drinks vodka soda with a splash of blood orange over the course of the meal We all split the check evenly to cover the birthday boy p m B gives me a ride home since all the guys are going to play glow ball golf with LED balls in the dark and apparently we are not invited I am annoyed at N who seems to be the one who created enforced the rule since I feel like I have not seen him much this week and I know he s going to come home very late and very drunk Once home I brush my teeth and knock out Daily Total Day Six a m I wake up and sure enough N is not in bed He must have gotten home really late and slept downstairs in the guest room I roll around for a bit enjoying having the king sized bed to myself while I mess around on my phone then get up and do some low key tidying before starting to get ready for work N is still not up at and I head to work early so I do not have to deal with him moaning on about his hangover whenever he finally surfaces a m I cave and text N to make sure he s alive He is at work so at least he did not call out he did not get home until after a m Also I am HUNGRY so I eat some dried apple rings Is it yet Uuughhhhh p m We have a company picnic at today but I generally do not feel good after eating at them so I sneak out a little early for lunch while everyone else is outside I spread some hummus on a GF Norwegian flatbread from TJ s and top it with a few slices of cheddar and then have a cookie from last night I feel unhealthy and make myself a smoothie p m After browsing cake recipes for a while I head out since I got in early I head over to BJ s for the second time this week to get flour and tuna I forgot I told our friends that I would make dessert for the birthday celebration we are having for C on Sunday I head to Market after and get butter sour cream a bottle of wine two jumbo grapefruit White Claw seltzers for and three very unripe avocados I accidentally forget to ring out

meet up with our friends B and L for dinner around and then go to a show with a few other friends at a local bar C ends up coming to dinner with us too We all split a plate of Reuben fries exactly what it sounds like a Reuben minus the bread on top of fries it s amazing and I get the Trash Browns for my main hash brown cakes topped with queso and a fried egg Amazing I also get a vodka soda I pay cash and N pays for himself p m We head over to the bar I get a glass of wine and N gets a High Life I pick up the tab since he bought me a drink last night including tip We realize halfway through our drinks that we are absolutely exhausted so we finish them head home and immediately pass out Daily Total Day Seven a m Sleeping for hours is the best decision I have made all week I feel like a new person N heads out to get a coffee He used to get K cups then ran out and decided he wanted something that takes up less counter space but has yet to buy a new coffee maker or take the Keurig off the counter Do not get me started I make my usual tea Morning Thunder by Celestial Seasonings It has mat√© and kind of tastes like dirt I am obsessed a m After doing the dishes I decide it s time to get our basil plants under control For some reason I let N convince me that we needed six basil plants Spoiler alert We do not I also have some carrot tops that I want to use up so I rip those up in the salad spinner and go out to pick enough basil to fill it up and then rinse it all off to make pesto Pine nuts are too expensive so I use pepitas and sunflower seeds Parmesan garlic and olive oil that I bought the other day It takes some tweaking but after picking more basil and adding extra salt we decide it s perfect I scoop it in a jar and put it in the freezer This is the second time I have made pesto this summer and I am going to have to probably at least two more times I am not complaining because I LOVE pesto but the ingredients are kind of expensive p m N goes over to talk to our neighbor and then they both walk over for some Bloody Caesars it s like a Bloody Mary but with Clamato juice it s popular in Canada Since our neighbor brought his vodka over I make myself a drink too with some fresh squeezed orange and lime juice We finished the vodka with the first round so we pull out some Hendrick s that was gifted to us and use that for the second round p m We head over to N s friend coworker s birthday party It started at noon but it s an all day affair so we do not worry about getting there at a particular time We intended to leave a couple hours ago but N had some unexpected technological issues so I waited and puttered around the house while he worked on that p m Free dinner We do not know too many people at the party but we know the people cooking so we decide to help them out with cooking steamers on the grill while they tackle a truly shocking amount of chicken I nibble on some baked beans two types of pasta salad and veggies I am trying to cut back on how much meat I eat since I have not been working out and do not need much protein these days Easier said than done when living with a meat lover but I do my best p m We are pooped and head home We had debated going out and getting a drink somewhere but no one we know is out and we are not really dressed for any of the bars We end up staying in and going to bed pretty early for a

2249,2249,David Flood BMC Health Services ResearchBMC series open inclusive and trusted201717 DOI 6 s12913 z Background Access to low cost essential generic medicines is a critical health policy goal in low and middle income countries LMICs Guatemala is an LMIC where there is both limited availability and affordability of these medications However attitudes of physicians and pharmacy staff regarding low cost generics especially generics for non communicable diseases NCDs have not been fully explored in Guatemala Methods Semi structured interviews with pharmacy staff and physicians in several highland towns in Guatemala were conducted Interview questions related to perceptions of low cost generic medicines prescription and dispensing practices of generics in the treatment of two NCDs diabetes and hypertension and opinions about the roles of pharmacy staff and physicians in selecting medicines for patients Pharmacy staff were recruited from a random sample of pharmacies and physicians were recruited from a convenience sample Interview data were analyzed using a thematic approach for qualitative data as well as basic quantitative statistics Results Pharmacy staff and physicians expressed doubt as to the safety and efficacy of low cost generic medicines in Guatemala The low cost of generic medicines was often perceived as proof of their inferior quality In the case of diabetes and hypertension the decision to utilize a generic medicine was based on multiple factors including the patient s financial situation consumer preference and to a large extent physician recommendations Conclusions Interventions to improve generic medication utilization in Guatemala must address the negative perceptions of physicians and pharmacy staff toward low cost generics Strengthening state capacity and transparency in the regulation and monitoring of the drug supply is a key goal of access to medicines advocacy in Guatemala KeywordsGeneric medicinesMedicine perceptionsGuatemalaPharmacist rolesAccess to medicinesEssential medicinesNon communicable diseases Background Access to essential medicines has been on the public health agenda since the s when the World Health Organization WHO published the first list of essential drugs and the Alma Ata Declaration proclaimed access to medicines as a pillar of primary health care Policies to promote drug access initially tended to focus on medicines for acute conditions and infectious diseases However in recent years the rapidly rising burden of chronic non communicable diseases NCDs in low and middle income countries LMICs has led to calls for improved access to medications for NCDs as well Surveys conducted in diverse LMICs have shown that essential medicines for NCDs tend to be unaffordable or unavailable in both public and private sectors Access to low cost essential generic medicines and to an increasing degree generics for NCDs is thus a critical health policy goal in LMICs However barriers to generic access are complex Demand side constraints may include health seekers negative perceptions of generics or uncertainties regarding medicine quality On the supply side numerous factors influence health providers who prescribe and dispense low cost essential medicines including efficacy and safety concerns lack of trust between physicians and pharmacies misaligned incentives between patient and provider and pharmaceutical promotional activity The pharmaceutical industry and generic medicines in Guatemala Industry analysts estimate total pharmaceutical sales in Central America in at US billion Guatemala the most populous country in Central America is the region s biggest pharmaceutical market Although approximately of the US million Guatemalan drug market by value is comprised of imported medicines with Mexico serving as the leading source of imports by value as of there are also domestic and two multinational companies authorized to manufacture medicines within the country Official documents report that of all drug purchases are made in the private sector and the vast majority of private health spending is out of pocket Prior research on access to medicines in Guatemala primarily focused on acute conditions has suggested that they tend to be unavailable or unaffordable In general accurate up to date and publically available information on the pharmaceutical and pharmacy industries in Guatemala is limited WHO defines a generic medicine as a pharmaceutical product usually intended to be interchangeable with an innovator product that is manufactured without a license from the innovator company and marketed under a non proprietary or approved name rather than a proprietary or brand name In contrast originator or innovator medicines are usually defined as the first drugs to be authorized or patented Generics can be branded or unbranded a branded generic refers to a generic drug sold under a trade name that is different from the originator name In addition a few pharmaceutical chains do exist in Guatemala which market similares non bioequivalent copy drugs These include branches of the Mexican chain Farmacias Similares which has transformed the private sector pharmaceutical market in Mexico However in Guatemala the market share for similares has remained low compared to the generics market In Guatemala multiple factors impact access to and perceptions of generics First Guatemalan intellectual property law offers relatively expansive protection for originator pharmaceuticals relative to peer countries which delays the introduction of new medicines into the generic market For example in the case of the long acting insulin Lantus¬Æ insulin glargine a generic version would still be restricted in Guatemala even after the drug lost its patent in the United States Second as in many other LMICs most generics sold in Guatemala are branded generics Branded generics in Guatemala are aggressively marketed to capture consumer loyalty thereby allowing a premium to be charged as compared to unbranded generics An important factor impacting the perceptions of low cost generics in Guatemala is concern regarding generic drug quality Although legal frameworks mandate drug and safety monitoring domestic generic manufacturers operate under laws that are outdated with respect to best manufacturing practices In addition the limited data available suggest that there are quality issues in the Guatemalan drug market For example in the international Medicines Quality Database whose results have been published in aggregate form eight of the medicine samples submitted from Guatemala failed to pass a quality test A series of dissolution studies carried out by students and faculty at San Carlos University in Guatemala showed that in multiple cases generic versions of drugs were not bioequivalent to originator products A Ministry of Health report found that of pharmaceutical quality tests did not comply with quality standards Robust and competitive generic pharmaceutical markets also require that consumers trust the public institutions tasked with monitoring and protecting the drug supply In Guatemala however there is deep mistrust of the political system and there have been numerous scandals in recent years involving collusion between government officials business elites and the pharmaceutical and pharmacy industries For example in alone four large pharmacy chains were fined for advertising false discounts on medicines international pharmaceutical companies operating in Guatemala were found guilty of colluding to raise the prices of some products and the Guatemalan Social Security Institute IGSS entered into a fraudulent pharmaceutical procurement contract that ultimately led to the arrest of high profile government figures including the director of IGSS and the president of the Central Bank Taken together such high profile scandals reinforce public skepticism of the integrity and safety of the drug supply in Guatemala Finally a multitude of ground level pressures and incentives tend to favor originator medicines over generics First although physicians in Guatemala are legally required to include generic names in prescriptions such laws are not enforced in practice In some cases physicians may steer patients to their own privately owned pharmacies creating a financial conflict of interest towards preferentially prescribing and selling higher cost products like originator medicines In addition retail pharmacies commonly advertise discounted or free in house clinical consultations as a business strategy to increase sales Finally while direct to consumer advertising in Guatemala is not legally permitted for any prescription medicine the scope of what is considered a prescription drug is very narrow and therefore the vast majority of drugs including antibiotics can be purchased over the counter In practice consumers are frequently targeted in advertisements for pharmaceutical products A newspaper advertisement Fig published by Fedefarma a trade group representing more than a dozen well known international pharmaceutical companies in Central America illustrates this dynamic well Fedefarma promotes originator brands to prospective consumers and clinicians by emphasizing themes of quality safety and bioequivalence Fig Advertisement in Guatemala promoting originator medicines over generic medicines In English the text reads I have diabetes If my medicine fails I could suffer a diabetic coma I do not play around I only use the real thing Trusted brands originator medicines have studies that back up their quality efficacy and safety Respect the medical prescription Ask your doctor or your pharmacist for originator medicines Image used with permission of Health Action International Against this background it remains unclear how the attitudes toward generics of pharmaceutical gatekeepers prescribing physicians and retail pharmacy staff impact the access and use of these medicines One recent study utilized an online survey to demonstrate that many physicians perceived generics to be of lower quality than originator brands while at the same time their prescribing practices were influenced by the affordability of such medicines for patients However this study did not examine how other factors such as how interaction with pharmaceutical representatives may also impact perceptions Additionally no studies have examined the perceptions of pharmacy staff towards generic medications or how pharmaceutical gatekeepers view generic NCD drugs These are important gaps in knowledge since medicines in Guatemala are largely purchased as an out of pocket household expense at pharmacies Even in the public sector medicines are often out of stock and thus public providers may write prescriptions for patients to purchase medicines privately Many health seekers eschew clinical providers altogether and directly seek care at pharmacies In this setting pharmacy staff may theoretically steer patients away from generics or upsell originator products To examine these issues we undertook a mixed methods study to explore physician and retail pharmacy staff s perceptions regarding generic and medicines and to investigate how these perceptions influence on the ground prescribing and dispensing decisions of generic medicines including drugs for NCDs Methods Institutional context and ethics This study was facilitated by Wuqu Kawoq | Maya Health Alliance a non governmental organization NGO working to provide health services including services for NCDs in rural indigenous Maya communities in Guatemala This study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Wuqu Kawoq | Maya Health Alliance and Partners Healthcare Boston All participants provided verbal informed consent Overview of methods The study consisted of semi structured interviews conducted with physicians and pharmacy staff in three locations in central Guatemala in the province of Chimaltenango San Juan Comalapa population Tecp√°n population and the provincial capital Chimaltenango These towns were selected as study sites because they represented large concentrations of patients with NCDs for the sponsoring NGO Sample recruitment Thirty retail pharmacy staff were recruited to the study through random sampling of pharmacies in San Juan Comalapa Tecp√°n and Chimaltenango Pharmacy staff was defined broadly to include any pharmacy worker who dispensed medications to clients regardless of level of training or professional certification People in San Juan Comalapa and Tecp√°n commonly purchase medicines both locally and in the city of Chimaltenango due to its central location along the major highway leading to both towns In each of these three towns the research team created a comprehensive map of all pharmacies and classified each pharmacy in one of five categories national pharmacy franchise discount local pharmacy non discount local pharmacy hybrid clinic pharmacy or government subsidized pharmacy through the national Program for Medication Accessibility PROAM In each town three pharmacies were randomly selected within each category In San Juan Comalapa and Tecp√°n fewer than three pharmacies were present for some categories in these cases all pharmacies within a town s category were selected In total across the three locations interviewees were recruited from distinct pharmacies whose classifications are reported in Table A Table Characteristics of pharmacies and physicians surveyed A Pharmacy characteristics n = Number percent Town of pharmacy surveyed San Juan Comalapa Tecp√°n Chimaltenango Category of pharmacy n = National pharmacy franchise Discount local pharmacy Non discount local pharmacy Hybrid clinic pharmacy Government subsidized pharmacy B Physician characteristics n = Town of physician clinic surveyed San Juan Comalapa Tecp√°n Chimaltenango Category of practice environment Public Private Private and public NGO Twelve physicians were recruited to the study from San Juan Comalapa Tecp√°n and Chimaltenango Convenience sampling was used The research team identified and contacted physicians in all three locations through referrals from health professionals working in San Juan Comalapa and Tecp√°n In Chimaltenango the research team performed site visits to clinics where the sponsoring NGO s patients commonly reported accessing care Across the three locations physician participants were recruited from distinct practice environments as reported in Table B Data collection Semi structured interviews lasting min were conducted with pharmacy staff and physicians in their place of work All interviews were conducted in Spanish Interviews with pharmacy staff focused on training perceptions of generic medicines prescription practices regarding medicines for diabetes and hypertension advice given to clients with diabetes and hypertension and opinions about the roles of pharmacy staff and physicians in care delivery Interviews with physicians focused on perceptions of generic medicines including generics for diabetes and hypertension prescribing practices and opinions about the roles of pharmacy staff and physicians in care delivery We opted not to define originator medicines branded generics or unbranded generics to research participants given that such definitions can be technically complex and that these terms are not used regularly in clinics and pharmacies in Guatemala As we were most interested in the perceptions and utilization of low cost generics which in Guatemala generally refer to unbranded generics we used the term generic in research questions in contrast to commercial brands as these are the terms most commonly used and understood by participants in this setting Detailed notes were taken during and after each interview and these serve as the basis for analysis Data analysis Qualitative data from interviews was analyzed using an inductive approach allowing dominant themes to emerge from interview notes Lists of responses to each open ended question were compiled in matrices organized by participant type Responses were then coded into thematic categories by one researcher IM Other team members collectively reviewed and arrived at consensus about the application of codes Finally as it was hypothesized that pharmacy staff and physicians perspectives might differ across interview topics coded responses in the matrices were compared across participant type Quantitative data derived from interviews were first entered into a spreadsheet and then imported into Stata StataCorp College Station TX for analysis In addition to descriptive statistics Fisher s exact test was used to compare categorical responses between physicians and pharmacy staff Results Demographics and education Thirty pharmacy staff and physicians were interviewed Demographic characteristics of participants are summarized here and in Table Of the physicians sampled eight were general practitioners who had completed medical school but no further training three had completed post graduate residency programs and one had received a master s degree in epidemiology Ten participants attended medical school in Guatemala and two in Cuba Table

level of formal education prior to entering the pharmacy business varied widely but was typically low with only two of respondents having received any formal post high school education When pharmacy staff were queried as to why they had entered the retail pharmacy field they expressed a diverse range of motivations including professional interest in the field desire to help people previous work in health care such as nursing or social work or economic necessity Participants often cited social connections as drawing them into the profession such as having a neighbor family member or spouse who worked in a pharmacy practice Level of pharmacy specific training or certification also varied widely Half of participants had received no pharmacy specific training of any kind Among those who did report receiving such training the quality and nature of the training was heterogeneous Some reported training that consisted of reading pharmacy books while others had engaged in on the job

than pharmacy staff to perceive generic medications to be less safe or less effective However these differences in perceptions were not statistically significant likely due to our small sample size Table Perceptions of safety and efficacy by pharmacy staff and physicians Pharmacy staff n = Physicians n = P value Generics are not as safe as branded drugs a a b Generics are not as effective as branded drugs a b aA few respondents answered do not know and their answers are excluded from this calculation bFisher s exact test Among pharmacy staff believed that generics were not as safe as drugs with commercial brand names whereas believed that they were not as effective When asked to elaborate on their perceptions of generic drugs nine pharmacy staff cited inferior manufacturing ingredients or low quality They also cited specific examples of clients who had experienced different therapeutic responses such as changes in blood pressure or glycemic control when switching between branded and generic medications as evidence of generics inferiority Eight participants reasoned that generic medicines low cost was in itself proof of low quality explaining that because they are too economical or cheap generic medicines could not possibly have equal effectiveness Five participants were concerned by reports they had read in the popular press or trade journals about the heterogeneous quality of various companies manufacturing processes Nine pharmacy staff reported that the distinction between generics and branded medications was the branding process itself the only difference is the brand because the quality is the same as one respondent remarked One participant distinguished between generic medicines made by trusted manufacturers and generic generics which the participant deemed to be less reputable Pharmacy staff who worked at a national pharmacy franchise or a for profit hybrid clinic pharmacy were more likely to view generics as less safe than those who worked at community or public pharmacies vs p = A similar trend effect was observed for the perception of efficacy but was not statistically significant vs p = Among physicians believed that low cost generics were not as safe as branded drugs and also stated that they were not as effective Nine participants expressed at least some reservations about the use of generic medications with typical comments including that they are not adequately manufactured they do not have good quality control and they do not offer the same results to the patient Physicians also acknowledged the heterogeneity of generic drug quality which was perceived to be dependent on the reliability of the manufacturer Like pharmacy staff some physicians reasoned that the low cost of generic drugs was itself indicative of inadequate quality When asked about the differences between generic and non generic drugs physicians cited prestige in addition to safety and efficacy concerns One physician explained that patients feel proud to be able to pay for expensive drugs Three physicians described prescribing low cost generic medicines and subsequently switching to a more expensive drug with a brand name when the generic version was perceived to be ineffective One participant explained that patients with previous exposure to high cost drugs with brand names would not respond as well when downgraded to a low cost generic version Interactions with pharmaceutical company representatives Pharmacy staff and physicians were asked about their interactions with pharmaceutical representatives Twenty six of pharmacy staff reported visits from pharmaceutical representatives Seven said that they had received incentives from representatives in the form of drug samples price discounts pens notebooks calendars prizes and informal presentations Nineteen pharmacy staff cited pharmaceutical representatives among the resources they used to learn about the latest pharmaceutical products Responses were similar among physician participants All but two of the physicians interviewed said that pharmaceutical sales representatives regularly visited them Of these four reported receiving incentives from pharmaceutical representatives including drug samples electronic office equipment payment of registration for conferences calendars and prescription pads When asked how they stayed up to date on current medical literature eight physicians cited information provided by pharmaceutical companies and their representatives among other resources No statistically significant relationship was observed between interactions with pharmaceutical representatives or the receipt of gifts from representatives with perceptions of safety or efficacy of generics for either pharmacy staff or physicians Generic drug utilization for diabetes and hypertension In the case of diabetes and hypertension prescribing practices of physicians and dispensing practices of pharmacy staff varied widely and were influenced in part by perceptions regarding the efficacy and safety of low cost generics When pharmacy staff were asked how they decide whether to dispense low cost generic medicine for a patient with a chronic disease they were in general agreement that it depended on patients financial resources and the severity of the condition with wealthier and sicker patients less likely to be dispensed generics Many pharmacy staff also emphasized that the decision to use a generic was ultimately up to the patient As one participant commented regarding chronic disease medicines I tell them do you want the expensive one or cheap one Some people die because they do not want to buy a generic medicine One pharmacy worker added that in the case of chronic diseases it was the role of pharmacies to educate people so they do not get tricked by brand name marketing Three physicians cited the patient s clinical history and prior drug regimens as important factors in deciding what to prescribe For instance one participant explained that a more severe clinical presentation or a very chronic disease would call for a non generic medicine although starting with a generic version and switching if it were ineffective might be acceptable practice Several participants expressed that concerns regarding the effectiveness and safety of generic medicines influenced their clinical practice One physician commenting on chronic disease medicines stated To prescribe generics is to play with the life of the patient Roles of physicians and pharmacy staff in providing chronic disease care The majority of pharmacy staff stated that a prescribing physician should determine the medicines for diabetes or hypertension Similarly most pharmacy staff reported that it is more common for patients with diabetes or hypertension to arrive at the pharmacy with a physician prescription in hand than to ask for a treatment recommendation at the pharmacy Only of pharmacy staff reported dispensing a medication other than the prescribed medication to a patient with diabetes or hypertension In addition to dispensing medications most pharmacy staff described providing additional medical counseling to patients with diabetes and hypertension Eighty percent of participants reported offering advice to patients with diabetes and reported giving advice to patients with hypertension Pharmacy worker advice for managing diabetes included exercise and decreasing the intake of sugar sugary foods and fats In addition to pharmaceuticals pharmacy staff participants also recommended vitamins herbs and electrolyte solutions specifically marketed for patients with diabetes When providing advice for hypertension pharmacy staff similarly emphasized increasing physical activity making dietary changes and improving psychological well being Participants also suggested natural remedies including chamomile tea and garlic with honey When physicians were asked about the overall role of pharmacy staff in patient care several key themes emerged In particular interviewed physicians expressed concern about the lack of formal training among pharmacy staff as well as their competing desire to broker the sale of medicines Physicians frequently stated that the role of pharmacists should be to dispense the medicines as prescribed by the physician without substitutions and to provide education about medicines Discussion Through semi structured interviews with physicians and pharmacy staff in Guatemala this study explored perceptions of low cost generic drugs in clinical practice and how these perceptions of pharmaceutical gatekeepers impact prescribing and dispensing decisions Our results offer several insights regarding use and access to low cost generic medicines including generics for NCDs that merit further discussion First both physicians and pharmacy staff expressed doubt as to the safety and efficacy of low cost generic medicines in Guatemala in part due to concerns about low manufacturing standards and quality control which influenced their daily prescribing and dispensing practices Our results echo studies from other LMICs where physicians and pharmacy staff have expressed mixed or negative perceptions regarding the safety and efficacy of generics One review examining physician perspectives of generic drugs found that doctors in LMICs tend to have less positive views of generics compared to doctors in high income countries who had more positive perceptions Another review of both physician and pharmacist perceptions of generics similarly distinguished between the high trust of generics in mature health systems and the low trust in generic quality manufacturing and bioequivalence in less mature health systems Second we found that both physicians and pharmacy staff in Guatemala utilize cost as a heuristic for the quality of the medicines they prescribe and dispense The use of cost as proxy for the quality of pharmaceutical products has been previously reported in Guatemala and in other LMICs Indeed there is some evidence that price does at times serve as an indicator for quality a recent study of essential medicines from private pharmacies in LMICs found that failing drugs were on average priced lower than non failing drugs Some commentators writing about Guatemala from the field of anthropology have argued that high priced health care products serve not only to emphasize perceptions of quality but also to appeal to a desire for social status and upward mobility In the present study this viewpoint is buttressed by the response of some participants such as the physician who remarked that some patients feel proud to pay for expensive drugs Furthermore others have shown that the commercial aspects of medications such as pricing may influence the placebo effect and it is therefore reasonable to speculate that cost may indeed affect clinical outcomes independent of a difference in intrinsic efficacy between products Third our results show that physicians pharmacy staff and consumers all play a role in determining whether a low cost generic is ultimately utilized in practice for NCDs The incentives of each of these actors and the forces that influence them are complex yet policy implications emerge We report that pharmacy staff generally though not always defer to physician prescriptions which points to a need to enforce laws requiring generic name in prescriptions and otherwise improve communication between prescribers and dispensers We also found that pharmaceutical representatives frequently visit physicians and pharmacy staff in Guatemala and provide education about new pharmaceuticals The ubiquity of these visits and the use of gifts and prizes call attention to a need for a well articulated government policy regarding interactions between pharmaceutical representatives and providers Although our study did not show a statistically significant relationship between perceptions of generics and interactions with pharmaceutical representatives the small sample size and very low numbers of recruited participants who did not interact with pharmaceutical representatives means that our study was significantly underpowered to detect a difference Fourth our results show that pharmacy staff generally have low levels of education and training yet they play an important role in educating patients about medicines and chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension Although this study was not designed to evaluate pharmacy worker decision making there is a significant literature showing that pharmacy staff in many LMICs including Guatemala do not deliver treatment advice in accordance with commonly accepted medical standards However in this study pharmacy staff reported that physicians should be the gatekeepers who determine diabetes and hypertension medicines for patients that it was more common for patients with diabetes and hypertension to present with physician prescriptions than to ask for advice at pharmacies and that they did not frequently switch out physician prescriptions These finding are at odds with the existing literature in the region which focusing largely on medications for acute illnesses finds that most dispensing occurs without the involvement of a prescribing physician Although these results are subject to methodological bias they are surprising and unexpected and they require confirmation and exploration in a larger study One possibility is that the culture of pharmaceutical dispensing is slowly changing in Guatemala with a move towards more formal reliance on physician prescriptions Along these lines it is worth noting that some key studies of pharmaceutical dispensing in the region are now more than years old and so it is likely time to revisit the issue including reanalyzing dispensing practices for antibiotics and other acute illness medications Alternatively it may be that informally trained pharmacy workers are simply less comfortably dispensing medications for chronic diseases This could be because of relative limitations in their knowledge about these medications exacerbated by the rapid diversification of and growth in products in the chronic illnesses market which are rapidly outpacing the relatively more stable market for antimicrobials analgesics and the like We also hypothesize that the higher cost of medications for chronic illness is a contributory factor Given the higher financial stakes it may be that clients or dispensing practitioners increasingly prefer to formalize transactions with the aid of a written physician prescription From a broader perspective previous literature outlines four main categories of barriers to the implementation of pro generic policies in LMICs legal barriers management and institutional barriers behavior perception and knowledge barriers and financial barriers This study principally addresses the third category in particular the perceptions of physicians and pharmacy staff and how these perceptions influence clinical behavior Our results indicate that improving attitudes toward low cost generics is an important goal At the same time as we have detailed in the introduction to this article there is compelling evidence in Guatemala to support the belief that the safety and efficacy of the drug supply cannot be guaranteed Indeed the issue of substandard and counterfeit medicines is a concern in many LMICs In the Guatemalan setting where regulatory information is limited and drug quality is uncertain it is thus not surprising that the high price of trusted pharmaceutical brands is therefore used as a surrogate marker for quality Taken in context our results also underline the fact that interventions to improve the perception of low cost generics and increase their utilization by physicians and pharmacy staff would be insufficient without commensurate efforts to strengthen the regulation and transparency of the drug supply Unfortunately in Guatemala s current political climate it is difficult to imagine any increased state capacity for regulating or ensuring generic drug supplies in the near future However we do see two potential promising avenues First in recent years the Guatemalan judicial system reinforced by backing from the United Nations International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala CICIG has made considerable inroads in fighting high level government corruption including in the health care sector We hope that CICIG s activities will reduce high profile drug procurement scandals such as those we mentioned in this paper s Introduction and may help to increase public confidence in generic medications Second we can see a role for voluntary self organization and self regulation by generics manufacturers Commitments to increased transparency and accountability for example through reporting on compliance with international manufacturing standards and bioequivalence testing could go a long way both in improving the quality of the generics drug supply and confronting the allegations of inferiority in both the popular press and the promotional materials of originator brands Such commitments would no doubt come at increased production costs but these could potentially be offset as public opinion improved and sales increased Study limitations and future directions This study has several methodological limitations that limit the generalizability of our findings First the sample size of physicians and pharmacy staff was small with limited power to detect some important differences especially regarding interaction with pharmaceutical representatives Physicians were recruited based on a convenience sampling strategy that could have introduced bias Second geographically participants were concentrated in one particular region of Guatemala and their opinions may not reflect the views of physicians and pharmacy staff throughout Guatemala In particularly the study did not sample participants in Guatemala City which is the country s dominant urban area from both a population and economic perspective nor did we consider the self reported ethnicity of providers or pharmacy staff themselves in creating our sample Additionally as we did not define originator medicines branded generics and unbranded generics to research participants we are unable to make firm distinctions among the perceptions of drugs in each of these categories The branded generic conundrum has emerged as a primary challenge of the generic medicine policy agenda Further inquiry into the perception price and utilization of branded generics in Guatemala in relation to originator products and unbranded generics is an important future research goal for our team We also intend to explore in greater detail the unexpected findings about reluctance to dispense medications for chronic illness without a prescription and to investigate more closely the relationship between prescribing practices and interactions with pharmaceutical representatives In this regard the frequency of interaction with pharmaceutical representatives we measure in this study will permit sample size calculations for an adequately powered subsequent study Conclusion This study demonstrates that physician and pharmacy staff s perceptions of low cost generics influence the utilization of these medicines in clinical practice especially in relation to the treatment of NCDs like diabetes and hypertension Interventions to improve the perception of generics and increase their utilization by physicians and pharmacy staff are critical At the same time additional research on changing dispensing practices of medications for both acute and chronic illnesses is needed as is further investigation of the impact of interactions with pharmaceutical representatives on prescribing and dispensing practices Although short term prospects for increasing state capacity for regulation and monitoring of the drug supply are limited we anticipate that the emergent anti impunity movement in Guatemala will increase public trust in generic medications by reducing high profile scandals over drug procurement schemes Furthermore we suggest that the generics industry through self regulation and self organizing could improve the quality of the generics market while simultaneously increasing their market share Abbreviations

I bought it not expecting to be able to use any parts but intending to take it apart and understand how it all goes together before working on the functioning engine in the car. Its been a useful learning process but to be able to do it, i needed a , a bit of 3mm angle iron i had in the store and some 3mm thick square tube and knocked up a bracket that bolted to the plate on the spare stand should i ever want to use that for a different engine with a more traditional bell housing. probably ¬£25 of steel and some welding consumables.Turned out alright after a coat of epoxy!

I told yall smashboards kiddos only want female characters for the sake of it and nobody believed me Am not! There's plenty of female options that are super-viable and can bring as much to the table as males do. It will be a shame if we don't get any. Cameron1058 't have to be provocative. There are plenty of female PG-rated smash requests out there. It doesn't feel right for an all-male pass They‚Äôre plenty of females already in Smash, not like there‚Äôs a huge lack of them. Not like there‚Äôs a desperate need for this last DLC character to be a female. Also, it isn‚Äôt all male. Banjo and Kazooie are a package deal and Kazooie is a female. She‚Äôs practically the star of the game since without her, the main appeal and gimmick of Banjo-Kazooie would be gone DLC counts as it can bring a ton of options into the game. Smash is missing out on them. You're all apathetic about the female demographic here. They‚Äôre also plenty of male characters that could be added and bring a ton of options. You got Kazooie, she‚Äôs a female. Hooray, they‚Äôre representing the female demographic!"

6836,6836,"Had horn problem, honest reason why I joined this forum, to add my repair. Horn would only work when I turned the steering wheel to the left. Every forum or site said the same thing. Horn contacts were bad. Fuse. Relay. Wire harness. Nada. I bought a new contact online, as I thought that was the cheapest and quickest fix. Didn't work. So I kept trying. Noticed that the turn signal switch had a copper rod sticking out touching the steering wheel. I removed the turn signal, cleaned the steering wheel with steel wool and applied dielectric grease(vaseline). Looked at the contact and saw that it was worn. I got a spring from a ball point pen, cut it down to size, and put it over the copper contact on the switch. Voila! It worked. I could have fixed it without buying the new contact but whatever. If you jave any questions please ask."
3237,3237,Torres The following contest is a TAG TEAM match set for ONE FALL with a THIRTY MINUTE time limit and is for the IPW TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIPS L s Theme A hits over the PA system as the lights dim and Scott Wilson steps out onto the stage to a loud reaction nodding his head and staring out at the capacity crowd with confidence He soaks in the atmosphere for a moment longer before strolling forward and stepping to the side as Changes by Lucidious suddenly replaces his music and the cheers nearly drown out the entire building as Jason Dave steps out from the curtain He pauses to give Wilson a grin and the two give a double high five before making their way down to the ring Torres Introducing first at a combined weight of pounds the team of THE LAST KING SCOTT WILSOOOOONNNNNNNN and JASON DAVVVEEEEEEE The two men move to their respective sides of the ramp to slap hands with the exuberant fans When they reach ringside they both leap to the ring apron and swing through the ropes into the ring at the same time taking off to opposite corners and leaping to the second to hype the crowd even further Nelson Well it sounds like Torres has just decided to do as The BombTrax have instructed They are still claiming that those IPW Tag Team Championships are legit when they are not Rose You know guys I am kind of getting tired of the debate If they are willing to put them on the line who gives a crap whether they are sanctioned by the company or not Crumb Can not you see what a dangerous concept that is Rose Marie I mean that would mean anyone can just declare themselves a champion without ever earning it Rose So Nelson So how about we stay on point Jason Dave defeated Youth last Chaos to ensure they would have this opportunity at Civil War despite the best efforts of The BombTrax Crumb True enough and now the two interlopers are on a collision course with a team that damn near beat them last time they were in a tag team contest Rose Marie Whatever These do gooders could not fight their way out of a paperbag The other two commentators just shake their heads as the lights go dim and Strangle Hold by Ted Nugent begins to blare across the arena Red strobelights flicker all around the building and finally settle on the entry way When the song settles into the breakdown Press with one of the IPW Tag Team title belts over his shoulder strides out from behind the curtain stopping at the top of the ramp to gaze intently out at the crowd Here I come again now baby Like a dog in heat Tell it s me by the clamor now baby I like to tear up the street When the first lines bellow out Youth with the other IPW Tag Team title belt around his waist appears flashing around in front of Press and spins a few times reaching out at the crowd who cheer in adulation He comes to a teetering stop facing the ring a coy grin on his face as he looks back at his massive partner who merely nods his approval Torres Introducing their opponents hailing from Las Vegas Nevada and coming in at a combined weight of pounds they are the uh IPW TAG TEAM CHAMPIONS PRESS FLAMING YOUTH THE BOMBTRAXXX Now I been smokin for so long You know I am here to stay Got you in a stranglehold baby You best get oughta the way Youth takes off into a sprint for the ring sliding in under the bottom rope and popping up with his hands over his head Press stalks up to the ring rising on the ring apron and then stepping over the top rope with one fist pumped over his head Youth takes a turnbuckle with a single bound and plays up to the crowd as Press turns and casually leans against the other corner staring across the ring at a very eager looking Jason Dave and Scott Wilson Crumb Well folks I d like to say that we are about to see a fair and even match for those fake titles but with these two it is not likely Rose See that s your problem right there Crumbum You always focus on the negative These guys have just been living up to their reputation as legit bad asses Nelson If by bad ass you mean backstage attacks after match beat downs and cheating to get ahead then yeah sure Their bad asses Rose Hush dear the match is about to start DING DING DING IPW TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH Jason Dave The Last King Scott Wilson versus The BombTrax Press Flaming Youth Jason Dave and Scott Wilson confer with one another over in their corner Dave continuing to stare daggers into their opponents who for their part seem pretty nonchalant Press leans against their corner and looks over to Youth with a shrug as the younger of the two begins doing rock paper scissors to see who will start Finally the big man sighs and plays the game coming up short with a rock being covered by Youth s paper He steps over the top rope out onto the apron and Youth turns around to find Jason Dave standing across from him Nelson Dave Youth to start this match as the two begin to circle feels like dejavu eh Rose What Are you Canadian now Nelson No I just mean these two faced off last sho you know what nevermind Crumb Well the two move into a collar and elbow tie up in the center of the ring both jockeying for position and it looks like Dave is going to have the upper hand here as he forces Youth back over into the neutral corner The referee calls for the break but Dave is still pushing against Youth when the referee interjects himself between the two men Finally Jason lets loose of his grip and the minute he does receives a paintbrush slap across the face from the BombTrack Dave looks furious shoving the referee out of the way just as Youth slips between the top and middle rope to create distance Jason tries clawing at the air to get a hold of him as the referee grabs him around the waist and pulls him back Dave and the referee have some severe words once back at the center of the ring and when Jason turns back to his adversary Youth has propped himself up across the top ropes in that corner as if he were lying down grinning from ear to ear Again Dave lunges for him but the referee is already there to get in his way Nelson I really do not know how wise it is of Youth to get Jason Dave so fired up He looks like he s ready to tear the little punks head off Crumb Yeah and now the two men are circling once more and move in for a lock up But Jason side steps it and drives his knee right into Youth s solar plexus Rose Another gut shot there from Dave with the same knee and now tee s off with a right hand that sends Youth stumbling back into the ropes J D steps up to grab Youth by the wrist and shoots him hard across to the other side Youth bounces off the ropes and Dave steps forward to meet him with a clothesline but it s ducked at the last minute Youth rebounds once again only this time Jason slides backward with an elbow but again Youth ducks it This time on the third rebound Dave steps to the center of the ring looking just to catch him no matter what direction he goes Just when it looks like he s going to get him Youth drops and baseball slides right between Jason s legs Popping up behind his man he catches Dave in a waistlock and with a burst of energy lifts him off the ground and throws him to the mat He quickly follows spinning around to the front to get the man in a front face lock as the referee tries his best to keep up with the action Nelson Youth showing his speed there against Dave but I will remind you that this is what happened last Chaos and Jason Dave was the one who came out victorious Rose You really are hung up on the past are not you Nelson I would just like to see someone finally put these two guys away and maybe stem the quell of the issues they have been causing Crumb Regardless Dave is now forcing himself and his attacker up to their feet and OH SNAP NORTHERN LIGHTS SUPLEX HAS YOUTH IN A PINNING POSITION One Two Thre KICK OUT Jason and Youth quickly scramble up to their feet and as Youth rushes at Jason to get the upper hand when he s completely taken by surprise with a snap arm drag He hits the canvas and bounces up coming in once more only to find another one that sends him back to the mat Youth pops up once more albeit slower and Dave is there with right fists that send him falling back into the opponents corner Dave quickly tags in Wilson who leaps into the ring and picks up where Dave left off opening up with right hands that have The Flash rocked He leads him out of the corner and moves to shoot him off the ropes and when he returns is there to meet him with a high arching back body drop Nelson Big impact for Youth and it s funny Dave and Wilson are running at a rabbits pace something that usually Youth would be able to combat with his own speed Crumb Yeah well it s hard to do anything when you are taking offense like these two are dolling out Rose If you nimrods would pay attention Wilson just got Youth to his feet and is looking to do something nasty Wilson reaches down and yanks Youth s left leg up so that it s trapped between their two bodies wraps his arms around him and then sends him soaring with a T Bone suplex that see s Youth crash hard to the canvas He clutches at his back as Wilson scrambles over for a quick hook of the leg One Two Thre BREAK UP BY PRESS Nelson Press with the assist but is now yanking Wilson up to his feet and waylays him with a massive right hand Crumb BUT HERE COMES DAVE Jason Dave launches himself at Press with a spear like maneuver that actually causes the big man to stumble all the way back into the nearby ropes Dave begins hammering right hands into his gut but Press brings a wicked elbow down into the back of the man s head followed by another that drops Jason to his knee Pulling him up by the ears he yells something unintelligible into his face but when he goes to toss him over the ropes to the outside by the scruff of his neck he s clobbered from behind with a double ax handle courtesy of Scott Wilson Rose Oh yeah Like this is fair Nelson Press is not the legal man and had no business being in the ring This is just comeuppance as far as I am concerned Rose Comeuppance my ass Crumb Whatever it might be Wilson has hammered Press up next to the ropes and Dave has recovered now the both of them are punching and kicking the big man all the way down to the canvas Stomps reign down on Press and he s unable to keep his hold on the ropes to stay upright as he s driven down to the mat The boots continue to come until he s all the way under the bottom rope and out onto the apron eventually shoved by the duo so that he crashes down to the concrete floor below Looking satisfied Wilson and Dave turn back towards the other BombTrack only to find Youth up and running right for them With a huge leap he collides with both men for a high cross body that sends all three tumbling right up and over the top rope to crash down on top of his partner Rose Surely that s wasn t the plan Nelson I do not know if it was or not but I like it Youth getting to his feet first and now coming in behind a rising Scott Wilson Crumb These two are still the legal men BUT YOUTH JUST SHOT GUN DROPKICKED WILSON FROM BEHIND SO THAT HE S SENT SPRAWLING GUT FIRST INTO THE STEEL STEPS Nelson And now he turns his attention back to Jason Dave whose trying to get to his feet and moves to whip him into the steel guardrai NO Rose REVERSAL Crumb ITS YOUTH S TURN TO TASTE THE STEEL AS HE COLLIDES SPINE FIRST WITH THE BARRIOR Nelson Wait Oh no Press just rose up from behind Dave and he has no idea HE TURNS AROUND RIGHT INTO THE BIG MAN S WAITING GRASP AND Crumb WHAT CAN EVERYONE BE THINKING AS PRESS JUST CHOKE SLAMMED JASON DAVE DOWN ACROSS THE HARD RING APRON Rose Probably You might always want to keep eyes on the other guy s partner during a tag match Press wipes a small trickle of blood away from his lip a wound picked up when being stomped into the mat earlier thanks to Dave and Wilson His nostrils flare a bit as he grabs the now injured Jason Dave up to his feet wraps his giant arms around the mans waist into a bear hug and then quickly snaps up and over into a belly to belly suplex that sees Press crushing J D into the concrete with a splat The crowd and announcers gasp at the impact and Press gets to his feet to survey his mayhem with a grin as the referee reaches a nine count He looks up realizing his partner is not in any condition to get back into the ring so he swipes one of his bear like paws at the referee s feet forcing him to leap or get clobbered and issues a stern warning Fortunately for all involved the distraction works and he picks up his count back at one Nelson I have to admit that was a smart move by Press to keep this contest going but it also gives him a little more time to cause some serious damage Crumb Yeah and it looks like he s waiting for Scott Wilson to dislodge himself from those steps DO not DO IT SCOTT HE S RIGHT BEHIND YOU Rose CRUMB Show some damn bias for Christ s sake Crumb What like The BombTrax have shown all of us over the past few months Whatever Wilson clutches at his bruised midsection possibly having injured ribs thanks to that introduction to the steel He slowly turns back towards the action only to find Press lumbering right for him leg starting to come up for his patented big boot At the last minute he s able to duck far out of the way and the big man s boot sails harmlessly over the steps That is until his posting leg collides knee first with the unforgiving steel Press lets a howl of pain as he sits down on the top step to clutch at his knee but the yelp is quickly cut off thanks to a sweeping superkick from Wilson that finds his boot practically in the big man s mouth Crumb WHAT CAN EVERYONE BE THINKING AS PRESS WAS JUST KNOCKED SILLY BY A WILSON KICK Rose Probably Man his eyes just went in the back of his head and that does not look natural Nelson Scott Wilson stumbling over to Jason Dave to check on his partner helping him up to his feet BUT HERE COMES YOUTH Flaming Youth sneaks in behind Wilson as he pulls J D up to hang onto the apron and grabs a handful of hair and tights to toss him back into the ring He springs up onto the ring apron just as Scott quickly comes to his feet and is already springboarding off the top rope by the time he orients Youth delivers a spinning wheel kick that slams The Last King down to the mat damn near taking his head off He quickly spins around and scramble over to hook the leg One Two Thre KICK OUT Nelson It s a good thing that Wilson was able to kick out of that because it did not look like Jason Dave would have made it in time Crumb Speaking of partners Look at Press He s sitting on those steps and propped up against the ring post out cold after that Wilson Kick Rose Do not you guys worry about him He s just resting his eyes Youth slams his fist off the mat in frustration after Wilson s kick out and quickly gets to his feet so that he can yank Scott to his He forces him back over to a neutral corner where he lowers himself to get leverage and lifts him up so that he s now sitting on the top rope Youth nods to the crowd who are on their feet as he climbs up to join Scott and he signals just before leaping up to sit on Wilson s shoulders and snaps back for an off the top hurricanrana To everyone s surprise The Last King is able to hook his legs through the ropes and Youth finds himself dangling upside down in a precarious position Wilson quickly grabs Youth by the tights and in an impressive feat of strength pulls the man back up into a seated position He immediately leaps from the second ropes forwards bringing Youth crashing down to the canvas with a sit out powerbomb that leaves the crowd breathless Nelson OH MY GOODNESS Crumb WHAT CAN EVERYONE BE THINKING AS SCOTT WILSON JUST BROKE FLAMING YOUTH IN HALF Rose Probably Fuccckkk Nelson Rose Marie I d chastise you right now but Wilson is hooking the leg One Two Thre KICK OUT The roof nearly comes off the arena as Scott Wilson falls off of Youth completely in shock The referee can not even believe it looking at his own hand to try and work the fact out in his head The Last King pushes off of Youth to regain his feet and then looks out at the crowd with a new resolve His thumb comes up to his neck and he slowly drags it across his throat and lets out a roar of defiance before turning back to Youth and begging for him to get up As he s doing that Press stumbles off of the steel steps shaking his head to get his bearings Looking up into the ring he notices his partner in trouble and with a grimace fishes under the apron until producing a steel chair Nelson And here we go I knew it Crumb Press just hopped up onto the ring apron with that steel chair and drew Wilson and the referee s attention away from Youth Rose That s right Blast that fools head off Wilson prepares to rush the big man before he can make it into the ring but Jason Dave suddenly appears on the far end of the apron that Press is standing on He sprints across the thin walkway to delivers a low dropkick right into the big man s bum knee causing him to tumble from the side and smack the floor below He grabs at his knee while looking up to see Jason Dave now in possession of the chair a wild look on his face Scott seeing his partner about to cost them disqualification calls out for Jason not to do it and he rushes over to stick his head through the middle and top rope to try and stop him Jason Dave however will not be moved A mask of rage coming over his face as he swings the chair high up over his head to a loud clanging sound as it meets something solid behind him Nelson Oh no Crumb What What can everyone be thinking as Jason Dave just accidentally cracked his own partner upside the head with a steel chair Rose Probably Mistakes are made when a do gooder tries to do something bad Dave slowly turns as Wilson clutches at the top of his skull and stumbles back through the ropes towards the center of the ring Just then Youth hooks him through the legs from behind dragging him down into a roll up pin and the referee who looks just as shocked as Jason Dave right now turns and on instinct starts to count Jason lunges forward but finds his movement impeded by Press who has grabbed him by the ankle and will not let go One Two Three The referee calls for the bell about the same time Press releases Jason Dave and J D slides into the ring scrambling towards Youth who quickly rolls out under the bottom rope on the other side Youth throws both hands up in the air mockingly as Dave takes a swipe for him over the top rope incensed Seeing that there might be more fight in Dave than he cares to deal with Youth ignores the referee and grabs the IPW Tag Team Championships and runs around the ring to join his partner by the ramp Torres And the winner of this match and STILL YOUR IPW TAG TEAM CHAMPIONS THE BOMBTRAX Nelson This this was an absolute train wreck And look at those hyenas Just laughing it up on the ramp as they make their exit Crumb I I really can not believe this Jason Dave was targeting Press and somehow cracked his own partner in the head when Wilson tried to stop him Rose That s called poetic justice Crumbum Nelson There is no justice in this Rose Marie If Press had not grabbed that chair in the first place then none of this would have ever happened Rose Please Jason Dave has been like a ticking time bomb for weeks now and he played right into The BombTrax hands That s called strategy Crumb It s called something but what now Jason Dave looks like he s on the verge of a meltdown as Scott Wilson gets to his feet to try and calm him down Much like their last tag bout Jason Dave is beside himself threatening the referee who quickly finds some room to bail out of the ring Scott Wilson still clutching his head approaches his partner with a wary hand but Dave knocks it aside fuming This time The Last King seems to have had enough and he uses both hands now to grab Jason by the arm and spin him around The two men are nose to nose as the fans rise to see what is about to happen To everyone s relief Jason finally sighs and while shaking his head steps back from his threatening posture and offers his hand to Wilson The Last King readily accepts and the two men move in for an embrace The fans begin to cheer but it s short lived as when they separate Jason retains his hold on Scott s hand yanking him in and to the side so that he can hook him around the head and then snaps him over into a rolling motion known as Natural Selection Cross Rhodes Crumb WHAT CAN EVERYONE BE THINKING AS JASON DAVE HAS JUST LAID OUT HIS OWN BEST FRIEND WITH NATURAL SELECTION Rose Probably Finally Jason Dave has removed that tumor he s been carrying around on his back Nelson ROSE MARIE This is serious Scott Wilson is down in the center of the ring and Jason Dave is stalking around like a savage wait oh no Dave comes to a full stop staring down outside the ring at the steel chair that was the cause of all of their problems With a snarl he leaps through the ropes to the outside scoops up the chair and then slides back in to pop up in the corner The fans come out of their shock and begin to boo as Jason begs for Scott to get to his feet and after a moment The Last King complies Wilson on wobbly legs slowly stumbles a step towards Jason Dave who tears out of the corner and wraps the chair clear around his head The sound of steel on skull sounds like a shotgun going off and Wilson takes one more stumbling step as he falls to the mat with the chair still attached to his head Dave steps back in satisfaction a chuckle escaping him as he closes his eyes and takes in the negativity from the crowd Nelson That I Crumb Yeah what he said Rose Wow I can not believe it I I think I might be a Jason Dave fan now Nelson Rose Marie that was completely despicable I can not believe that you can condone this Rose Oh C mon Nelson Scott Wilson was dragging this team down He s the reason they lost Not once but twice Jason Dave is just doing exactly what any rational person would do face with those kind of odds Crumb You know Rose Marie sometimes you really scare me Rose Thank you Crumbbum Jason Dave continues to stare down at his unmoving partner for a few more seconds before finally bailing out of the ring himself as the EMT s rush the ring to check on Scott Wilson Dave does not seem to be affected by the crowds reaction at all stoically making his way through the curtain to exit Nelson Believe it or not folks the shocks are sure to keep on coming at Civil War because we still have to crown a Heavyweight Champion here tonight Rose That s right so why do not we cut to commercial or something so that the EMT s can finish up here and we will be right back with more IPW action

Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: , music festivals have become big business. Annually there are around 800 music festivals in the US alone. It's an industry worth nearly $10bn, attracting 32 million revellers annually, half of whom are millennials. Tickets average ¬£200 per head in the UK, but over the last 10 years music festival ticket prices have risen way above the rate of inflation. More than $1.5bn was spent by companies sponsoring festivals in 2014. The live music industry is booming as traditional record sales flounder. Artists can command up to 90% of gross ticket receipts but bag only 10% of the net profit from recorded music. Acts such as The Flaming Lips and Damian Marley can earn up to a reported ¬£90,000 per performance. Whereas bigger names such as Justin Beiber and Madonna can charge up to a cool million.

networking with multiple groups on WeChat has helped with that issue said Tingzhou Wu a spokeswoman for the association in Millburn We re saying Let s chat Do you guys want to buy this together she

in fear for their safety transcript Listen to The Daily I Become a Person of Suspicion Hosted by Michael Barbaro produced by Lynsea Garrison Stella Tan and Neena Pathak and edited by Lisa Tobin and Liz Baylen As bigots blame them for the coronavirus and President Trump labels it the Chinese virus some Asian Americans now live in fear for their safety michael barbaro Jiayang do you remember the first time that you started thinking about the backlash in this country against Asian Americans in response to the coronavirus jiayang fan Yeah I mean around I guess this is the beginning of March I had seen on Instagram a friend and a fellow writer documenting an incident in Manhattan where I think he is Korean American and he was told by a stranger to get away But I remember reading about that incident and thinking yeah I mean that s really terrible that this has happened but wondering is this a singular incident or is there a trend As a journalist and perhaps by my own personal temperament I m pretty cautious I don t like to make sensational generalizations that go well on a headline I feel like I need very convincing proof that something is happening before I call it And especially as a Chinese American I wanted to make sure that I was not crying racism before I had the full evidence I wonder if it s because if I don t make too big a deal out of it it won t be fully real michael barbaro From The New York Times I m Michael Barbaro This is The Daily woman I get to the gate at LAX man Home Depot woman In an Uber Pool man A grocery store Wegmans child We were walking from the gym to get in our classrooms man I got some milk a little pasta Most everything s gone woman And at that moment there was this guy looked like a regular guy He was staring at me michael barbaro As the death toll from the coronavirus rises in the U S so do reports of verbal and physical attacks against Asian Americans woman And a couple of seats away from me a man was seated And presumably his wife comes back to sit down and says out loud man You people you brought it You re sick woman Fuck China child China is stupid man I ought to kill you I ought to shoot you woman This girl looks Chinese She must have the virus I can t sit next to her michael barbaro Who say that they are being blamed for the pandemic archived recording journalist A person at the White House used the term kung flu My question is do you think that s wrong archived recording donald trump Kung flu archived recording journalist Kung flu And do you think using the term Chinese virus that puts Asian Americans at risk that people might target them archived recording donald trump No not at all No not at all I think they probably would agree with it It comes from China There s nothing not to agree with I ll have the last question michael barbaro Today man When the president asked I don t think they would mind it being called the Chinese virus I mind child It did make me feel different and didn t really want to be Chinese because of the coronavirus michael barbaro Jiayang Fan a writer for The New Yorker magazine shares her story It s Friday April th Jiayang can you tell me a little bit about your childhood Where did you grow up jiayang fan I was born in in Chongqing China My mom was a doctor My dad was a researcher And he was one of the first batch of scholars sent to the U S to bring Western knowledge and technology back to China So he leaves when I m about two so I have very little memory of him But for my mom and I life in China feels very serene and comfortable speaking chinese Whatever sense I have of the outside world the world beyond China is very very vague and incredibly hazy like I m not quite sure it exists But I think if one place were to stand out it would be the United States I remember my mom and her friends talking about the show Dynasty which did telegraph the glamor of the U S archived recording I like that one It s a rather expensive fur I like the mink That is mink jiayang fan The sense that this is what an everyday Joe would inhabit michael barbaro And this of course is a soap opera about an incredibly wealthy oil family living in a crazy gorgeous home and driving along oil fields So it s actually quite exceptional archived recording My name happens to be Mrs Steven Carrington I m not used to haggling over what suits me or what it costs jiayang fan Well it was the show and it was also at the time in China what was very popular were these calendars of American families where every member had golden hair sparkling blue eyes and perfect bone structure and they were always smiling with their perfect white teeth They always were sitting by a perfect colonial house or just out in nature but in front of a park that they looked like they owned laughter And I remember the food that really encapsulated America to me were Cheerios michael barbaro Cheerios archived recording It s the big yellow box that everyone knows jiayang fan Yes Cheerios I had no idea what they tasted like but the company did fantastic branding in China archived recording Cheerios number one We love it Toasty oat goodness jiayang fan I remember the picture of the perfect baby on these ads for Cheerios You know the round cheeks the blue eyes That baby got to have this superior breakfast food that I in all likelihood would never get to taste archived recording Cheerios number one jiayang fan So there s me drinking my Chinese porridge and eating my pickled vegetables and having fantasies about Cheerios which I learned years later to not be very tasty at all there They re actually tasteless michael barbaro To be like the definition of blandness but in your mind they are this superior food for this blond haired perfect group of people jiayang fan Yeah for superior people to put it bluntly I mean I still remember actually the first time I heard English I think it might have been my fifth or sixth birthday and my mom might have come back pretty recently from English language training sessions And she just said the words happy birthday That was astounding to me It was like my mom was superwoman that she knew how to say this language that did not sound like a language to me Happy birthday I still remember the way the syllables came out of her mouth and the image which was of a tsunami There was this tidal wave of one syllable consuming the next one that to me was very incomprehensible And I remember at the time thinking I will never learn this language I have no hopes of ever learning this language Which is probably OK because I only need one language right And it s Chinese michael barbaro Oh speaking chinese jiayang fan But essentially something happens in the June of that changes my father s fate as well as that of my mom and I forever archived recording journalist The noise of gunfire rose from all over the center of Peking jiayang fan The Tiananmen massacre archived recording journalist There s a mood of terror in the center of the city and quiet jiayang fan So the U S government immediately makes provisions for Chinese scholars who might need to flee from China archived recording journalist The demonstrators in Tiananmen Square jiayang fan And that was when my mother and I joined my father in the U S speaking chinese michael barbaro What do you remember about first arriving in the U S jiayang fan We land in J F K and my father is living at the time in New Haven Connecticut And that drive from J F K to New Haven it is gray and drab like tones that are not at all what I had imagined So I keep waiting for the real America to reveal itself to me So it is a rude awakening when my dad leads us to his second floor studio There s just a mattress on the floor and I think it takes me a good minute to realize that this is my new home And the loss of a language is pretty traumatic for me michael barbaro How so jiayang fan School started a few months later and I could not understand my teachers my classmates And repeatedly my new American teachers ask me why aren t you talking more Why aren t you engaging And those expectations I think are hard for me to fully understand And I feel like I m walking blind into a game where I don t know the rules michael barbaro Mm hm jiayang fan I mean not only do I not speak the language I m bringing pickled fish and rice and that s not sitting well with the other kids at a lunch table All I feel is defeat michael barbaro Hm It sounds very lonely jiayang fan Yeah retrospectively I think what made me feel most lonely was that I couldn t share those feelings with my mother And I think for my mother who worked very low paying menial labor jobs in the U S a drastic step down from her position as a doctor in China she must have felt as marginalized and as embarrassed by her immigrant status as I do but in an adult way but similarly lacking in an emotional vocabulary to express those feelings michael barbaro What do you mean jiayang fan Like I remember going to the mall for the first time with my mother And my mom s favorite pastime was window shopping just looking at things that she couldn t afford And I remember one time someone trying to hand her maybe a flyer for some store and she said no thanks But she couldn t pronounce it correctly so this young man said No sex Did you say no sex No sex And I think I was like or at the time I remember that my mother actually just in this embarrassed way laughed like out of anxiety like she wanted it to be OK She wanted to respond in a way to indicate that she was not offended But I remember the way that my cheek just felt hot and red they grew and how I felt so humiliated on my mother s behalf And that experience feels seared into my brain not just because of the insult but because my mother had to swallow her own humiliation michael barbaro Did you understand given your age that this was racism I mean how did you process it in that moment jiayang fan I think I turned over the incident in my mind for a long time after that I don t think I would have coded it as racism I think I almost only understood racism as something that white people inflicted on black people I had no idea or I had very little idea of how Asians fit into the landscape of race in the U S And I didn t know how to understand incidents in which you were not called a very specific racial slur Like that no thanks no sex Like michael barbaro What was that jiayang fan What was that Exactly I think as an year old in my head I didn t want to be different I didn t want to be the one lashing out at others for being racist because inevitably that would make me seem even more different And I think my mother my mother was the closest person in my life But if she had a religion it would be survival I learned from my mother not to rock the boat not to shake the existing system to basically understand how the existing system works and then to ascend it in some way to climb the ladder As long as you fit in better you will live a more comfortable life here And that should be the goal michael barbaro And did things start to get a little bit better eventually jiayang fan I start speaking better English I start really enjoying and then falling in love with the English language something that I thought would never happen That s really important for me I have to admit When that language English came to feel like a part of my body I have to say that felt like a homecoming to me michael barbaro Hm And how old are you at this point where you re starting to fall in love with the language jiayang fan I think around maybe or michael barbaro Mm hm jiayang fan And I ll never forget the first time in sixth grade when I said the phrase come on Like this sounds silly but it was only sixth grade when I could comfortably say come on to a schoolmate and I felt very triumphant michael barbaro As if to say enough of that come on jiayang fan Exactly When I could say that I was so aware of myself saying it and I was saying it the way that a normal American speaker would say it And I ll never forget the sense of pride that coursed through me And there was no one I could celebrate it with right Because imagine if then I turned to the classmate who I said come on with and said did you hear me I just said come on laughter That would have totally defeated its purpose but I remember it because it felt like a real Americanism And it just rolled off my tongue michael barbaro So in that moment you finally feel like you belong jiayang fan Exactly But I still see myself predominantly as a visitor and that my existence is pretty probational on good behavior And if I behave well I will be able to minimize the number of times that I stick out as someone who doesn t belong But then I started to realize that s not exactly how it works michael barbaro We ll be right back So Jiayang I wonder if you can tell me about what happened to you recently jiayang fan So this was in mid March when there were rumors that New York City would be put under lockdown because of coronavirus And I wanted to make sure I had enough food in the house if I had to stay in for an indefinite period of time michael barbaro Mm hm jiayang fan And I was also really worried about my mother who has a neurodegenerative disease and lives in a nursing home close by I knew that I wouldn t be able to see her for a while and I had several errands lined up One was to take out the trash One was to mail my rent check And one was to go a few blocks away to my neighbor s house to pick up a sack of rice It was around evening time and I had just left my apartment building and I was on the phone talking to my mother s health aide in Chinese And as I was turning around after putting the trash in the trash bin this is right in front of my apartment I heard Chinese Chinese Chinese bitch Fucking Chinese But it all I don t think I fully believed what I was hearing And when I made eye contact with him he kept speaking You re fucking Chinese And I realized that that I was comprehending that what he was saying did not stop him michael barbaro Mm hm jiayang fan That was when in my ear my mom s aide paused and said Are you OK Is something happening And I couldn t really speak I found myself walking down the street I think I was still really set on I need to get rice but then I found it really hard to continue walking because my legs just felt leaden Like I really really wanted to continue walking It would have only been a minute walk away for me to fetch that rice but I found myself coming to a halt And even I thought if I just kept talking on the phone with my aide but then I thought I m talking in Chinese Who else am I going to offend And then I just got off the phone And once I got off the phone I felt even more scared because I was so aware of being alone michael barbaro So this is not embarrassment or even shame in this moment This is just terror jiayang fan This is a very real sense of fright that I m not going to make it to my friend s house to get my sack of rice michael barbaro Jiayang we started this conversation with you saying that your instinct and maybe it s because you re a journalist maybe it s as an Asian American maybe it s both is to minimize these incidents and to be slow to see them as part of a larger phenomenon But it sounds like this was different for you Am I right to think that jiayang fan Yeah I mean this is not the first time I ve been called a Chinese bitch But what was different about this incident was that this man seemed to really mean it And I wondered I mean in retrospect right I wondered at the relationship between the sense of conviction in the man s voice his certainty that he was in the right to point out my Chineseness and to call me a Chinese bitch michael barbaro Mm hm jiayang fan And I think about the things that were going on in his day like did he lose his job earlier in the day because of this virus I mean does he work in the service industry Does he have a loved one who has also become a prisoner in a nursing home or hospital And I think about the way that all those anxieties and rage and sadness might have hardened into something like an instrument almost a weapon michael barbaro Hm jiayang fan And I think about me being a surface onto which he could use that weapon and lash out michael barbaro Hm jiayang fan And I think about the probational nature of my Chinese American existence in a sense that in better times in normal times there are certain stereotypes that are cast upon me when I walk down the street But in a moment of crisis when it seems plausible that the country where I was born could be responsible for an unprecedented pandemic that I become a person of suspicion and I become someone who is quite easy perhaps to target all your ire and anxieties and that maybe it gave him temporary relief to be able to identify someone or something as the cause for his hurt and for his anxieties michael barbaro So what do you do jiayang fan So I go home double lock my door pull out my phone and get on Twitter tutting OK yes I describe what happened and I tweet I wasn t offended I was afraid I was worried he knew where I lived For the longest time I ve been telling friends in China that although racism against Chinese exists in this country that s not what I feel in a pandemic I ve never felt like this in my years in this country I ve never felt afraid to leave my home to take out the trash because of my face I want to believe what happened is anomalous and that we re living in extraordinary times and fear can deform us I wonder now if I should have taken his picture michael barbaro I wonder what your mother would make of this incident And I wonder what she would think of the fact that you decided to share what happened to you so publicly jiayang fan I think if I were to tell her about the experience she might not fully understand the import of it She would say Well were you hurt And I would say No And she would say Well did you lose anything And I would say No And she would say Do you feel like this man is going to cut you down and kill you now And I would say Probably not no And she would say Well why are you even telling me this What is the big deal here michael barbaro Hm jiayang fan Or if I were to tell her that I was having this conversation with you she would say Why make something out of nothing Right She would say Why are you crying victim here Why are you making this into a bigger deal than it really is Do you want this to be how you re remembered for being that woman who was the victim of a non incident michael barbaro And what would you say in this imaginary conversation with your mother jiayang fan I think I would try in English because I think it would be hard for me to find the words in Chinese to explain the significance of it not on my physical well being michael barbaro Help me understand what you mean jiayang fan Because for the longest I mean I think my mom and I both lived with this fiction that if we could be perfect versions of ourselves for example if my mother could pronounce thanks the way that it s supposed to be pronounced and for me if I could say come on naturally that had always been the goal of our American existence was to somehow bend ourselves to a shape that America could accept I never dared to believe that I could actually help to make America better That was something I never dared to think was possible But in experiencing this it made me rethink my role as an American and how even me even someone who is probationary that I was in some very very small way contributing to this country by pointing out the ways that it s failing itself making clear the way in which this country still makes me feel ashamed is possibly one way in which I can make it better michael barbaro Hm jiayang fan And also that s the best version of America Like in all the conceptions of America that exist in my head I actually think this ability to call out the worst parts of America to itself my freedom to do so this feels to me the most miraculous part of America But I think all of that would be frankly a bit too abstract to my mother I think her quest for survival has been so concrete and lived I ll never be able to repay her for the way that her very concrete existence has paved the way for my more luxuriantly abstract one but that maybe that s a boundary between us that I ve been able to cross and that no matter how many ways I try to explain it in what language if she ll fully understand But I really needed to make sure that for my own sake I could know that this did happen that this was not a figment of my imagination or that in an hour s time or in hours time I would try to minimize it in my own mind michael barbaro Thank you very much for your time We really appreciate it Jiayang jiayang fan Thank you so much for having me michael barbaro I m so sorry that you had the experience you had jiayang fan I am too But I m sure it will be a small experience in what is hopefully a very long and a much bigger one of living in America and being American speaking chinese michael barbaro We ll be right back Here s what else you need to know today man Majority leader archived recording mitch mcconnell Our nation continues to battle the coronavirus pandemic More than Americans have tested positive Nearly have lost their lives And important public health measures are creating an economic catastrophe michael barbaro On Thursday the Labor Department said that another million Americans filed for unemployment benefits in the past week archived recording mitch mcconnell That means Mr President more than million Americans have lost their jobs in only the last three weeks a tragedy that is hard to even comprehend michael barbaro Economists now believe that the U S unemployment rate is the worst since the Great Depression The latest figures put even deeper

came together for the country To my Democratic colleagues please please do not block emergency aid you do not even oppose just because you want something more michael barbaro But Republicans led by

institutions to respond and how the opposite is true with close knit high affinity groups Mr Shen said Call me a new immigrant but I m confident in the importance of this ad hoc effort Eight hospitals have asked the Millburn association for help since it began its initiative At last count close to Chinese manufacturers of masks and other protective gear had been screened by about volunteers Our volunteers can tell what s fake and what s not in one second said Maria Wu another spokeswoman for the Millburn association Once hospitals sign a waiver the masks are theirs By mid April the Millburn association expects to receive at least more masks and coveralls directly from China It s been a community consensus Maria Wu said We need to stand up and do something to protect the people who are protecting us Especially since some of those people are dealing with discrimination on the front lines There s been a few attacks against Asians and patients are very cautious around Chinese doctors said Sun Hoo Foo a neurologist at NYU Langone Medical Center s Tisch Hospital who is also a member of the Coalition of Asian Americans in Private Practice Although Dr Foo is currently recovering from Covid the disease caused by the coronavirus at his home in Alpine N J he said he is eager to return to the hospital If I could go back to work now I would he said My only concern is spreading the virus to someone else Dr Ngai of Columbia said Dr Foo s attitude is the prevailing one Some individuals bias toward Chinese Americans would not prevent the community from helping to end the crisis she said Hopefully when people see what Chinese groups are doing they ll dial back some of this attitude she said Dr Lee hopes so too I hope people understand that the American Chinese community is very much vested in American life he said We re born Chinese but we re Americans by heart

2657,2657,It takes a lot of effort to make a movie Out of all of the different art forms films are largely a collaborative project that can employ thousands of people As a film critic it s important to maintain a level of respect for the process most movies are the result of on average two years worth of dedication and hard work and every finalized product is an accomplishment in itself Looking from the outside and wanting in was the year I decided to finally make the first step and try my hand at making my own film with the aim of entering it into festivals It was going to be relatively simple just a short seven minute documentary that highlighted the benefits of certain therapies in aged care facilities I think you know what happened The coronavirus SARS CoV As its spread got closer to home it soon became obvious wasn t going to be the year after all I had to shut down my production It got me thinking if this virus impacted my little project then how was it affecting everything else in the industry As the weeks rolled on and the news snowballed faster the answer has become clearer though there are still a lot of unknowns This article will be filled with a combination of facts and anecdotal reports but mostly whimsical predictions along with an assessment on the future of GUG s movie loving department It s important to note I am not a virologist immunologist pulmonologist or doctor of any kind so if anything I say ends up going against the advice of health experts then please pick their words over mine I do know film or at least pretend to possess some random expertise in zoology and criminology and I m an INTJ which apparently means I m gifted in noticing trends and seeing the bigger picture even though that whole MBTI thing is a pseudo science in itself Anyway let s just roll with it The Impact on Film Productions How this coronavirus has impeded a specific film project will depend entirely on how far along it is in production There are three main stages pre production production and post production Pre Production Pre production includes all the tasks that need to occur before physically shooting the movie Location scouting hiring crew casting storyboarding creating shoot schedules among many other things Unfortunately a lot of this prep work will now be null and void particularly when it comes to work contracts A shift in dates means a shift in availabilities Productions that were close to their shoot deadlines would be the ones affected the most as they d need to reschedule to a later time though that may prove difficult if the cast and crew are already booked for something else Arguably the most famous movie that will be affected is Marvel s Thor Love and Thunder Helmed by Taika Waititi and planned to be filmed in my hometown of Sydney Australia originally there were fears this production would be delayed by the country s devastating bushfire season Waititi was set to come to Sydney in April to begin pre production aiming to start shooting in August Suffice it to say with multiple countries around the world closing their boarders and enforcing strict rules on social gatherings this schedule simply seems unfeasible Yet with Hemsworth and Portman already attached to other future projects the halt of this production will prove to be a headache for producers when it comes time to reboot it Sadly Waititi delayed work on his Akira film adaptation in order to make room in his schedule for the Marvel movie which means anime fans will have to wait even longer for this project to see the light of day Production The production period entails the actual physical filming of the movie This is where production and set designers roll in and perform their magic makeup and hair artists spend hours on their creations gaffers light up the room costume designers transform the actors cinematographers see all their planning come to fruition whilst the boom operators lament about being forgotten once again in the pre production phase and why no one thought filming under a flight path would be a problem I feel your pain Depending on the size of the production this could mean there could be hundreds of people passing through the set every day Also a lot of Hollywood level productions are filmed in far flung locations and seek to hire veterans in their respective fields meaning the most prestigious films tend to have older cast and crew members With social distancing rules in place cities and even entire countries in lockdown and with a responsibility to keep their older workforce safe this makes your typical Hollywood film impossible to make The film productions caught in this period of their life cycle will be hurt the most Mission Impossible was one of the first movies to be postponed due to filming on location in Italy Baz Luhrmann s upcoming Elvis flick is suffering the same fate with the shoot being delayed due to Tom Hanks testing positive for COVID One of the biggest question marks is over Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings This was the biggest production in Sydney with casting calls for hundreds of extras being listed for months prior I even auditioned though they were predominantly looking for Asian actors Essentially everyone in the Australian industry knows they were planning on filming in early March There was a brief window of time where this could have been successful although the shoot schedule was delayed when director Destin Daniel Cretton decided to voluntarily self isolate for the sake of his family This pushed back the production by two weeks which not only caused Marvel to bleed K a day for the wait but was also during this time Australia toughened their workplace laws How close were they to finishing No one really knows Whether it can still be completed while also complying with new social distancing rules remains to be seen Similar to features that were caught in pre production this postponement will affect contracts and it may be a while before everything can align again so filming can resume Don t be surprised if a few studios decide to cut their losses and cancel the project entirely Worse still are those productions that almost finished shooting and only needed an extra day or two there may be a few that ll end up botched with a we ll fix it in post mentality resulting in a product that will share the same fate as the horribly made The Snowman where they tried to piece together a story that wasn t entirely filmed Despite an A List cast The Snowman couldn t be saved because they simply ran out of time to shoot all of the script Post Production Given the current circumstances this is the best position for a film project to be in Post production is when the footage is edited the dialogue is tidied sound effects are designed and mixed visual effects and animation are rendered the score is composed and everything comes together under the director s vision A lot of this work can be done through online correspondence and in relatively isolated workspaces Essentially if you see a film listed as being in post then consider it mostly safe it s just more of a question as to when and how it will be released The Impact on Cast and Crew SARS CoV has made a massive dent in the livelihoods on thousands of people working in the arts Producers are hindered by an uncertain future unable to make decisions surrounding upcoming productions Whether a person finds employment depends on their role in a film s life cycle Those in pre production positions will find themselves stuck in limbo whilst production crews cannot operate at all As above it is those in post production positions that may still obtain work at least for the time being and only if they were already hired on a project when everything shut down Simply put very little is being made and eventually that will trickle down to the editors sound designers and composers once their current gigs conclude Animators may actually be in the best position as their work isn t dictated by live sets and voice acting can still take place given the right set up There is some glimmer of hope and that s actually with the little discussed corporate sector Most people think of the film industry as being a choice between movies and television but businesses make up a large portion as well As there is a sudden push for online content this has equaled a surge in corporations needing short videos for either advertising or communication purposes When I made the call to cancel my own film production my cinematographer decided to meet with me anyway if only to commiserate over these dark times While he agreed the corporate sector had fired up he expressed a fear it may bring about a change where businesses may realize it s not too difficult after all he worried their dependency on film professionals may come to an end as they seek to source talent within their own ranks and slash quality to preference efficiency As an older gentlemen who had already paid his mortgage many years ago he considered himself blessed to be in a position where he could stop work and still survive and instead focus on writing for a while Yet many of his workmates are not so lucky Many cinematographers operate their own studios where they can be approached by businesses seeking their film expertise This essentially means they re paying the rent for two places Their workplace and their home When the work started to dry up I saw various film professionals many of which are regularly hired for television films and corporate shoots so certainly not novices scramble to find job listings for any kind of work My cinematographer feared many might not have a choice but to pack up and live in more rural areas where the rent is cheaper effectively leaving the industry for a substantial amount of time This virus will turn the world upside down in many different ways While those at the very top won t be financially affected I mean do the likes of Spielberg Hans Zimmer and Roger Ebert ever have to work again those mid career might find themselves struggling to make ends meet Ironically it is those just starting out still living with older relatives and running around with DSLRs that have the better chance of seeing this through As for actors there are still a surprising amount of job listings When one of my gigs fell through I was shocked to suddenly get a call for a voice over job Admittedly some casting calls are questionable Universal Studios Singapore are still looking for cast members causing everyone to wonder how exactly that s possible considering the border is now closed As someone who is currently considered to be at risk to a more severe presentation of COVID the paranoia is starting to take hold Who are these people that think they can still shoot How many will be on set Where have they been and are they infected A gig based work culture means constantly adapting to many unknowns though while it s usually exciting and refreshing now it s a world filled with caution Celebrities Many eyes will turn towards celebrities Their role in a crisis such as this will be analyzed for decades to come They play both sides of the coin Since they are famous they are in contact with an above average number of people and yet they can also be highly reclusive and have the privilege and means to survive without work When Tom Hanks tested positive for COVID some feared he would be Australia s equivalent to patient in South Korea A number of news reporters needed to self isolate whilst the Sydney Opera House shut down for immediate cleaning Thankfully meeting Tom Hanks is a memorable event and so cases were tracked down more easily than normal No he wasn t given a volley ball whilst in isolation That was fake news Although it would ve been funny They are role models and fans may take comfort in the fact even people as powerful as them are also stuck in their living rooms just like the rest of us Expect to see an increase in online content from celebrities that are just trying to do their part to make this world a little brighter Though there is a limit With many in society losing their jobs or worse their loved ones to this horrible virus a performance from an out of touch celebrity may ruffle feathers as opposed to smoothing them The internet is an unforgiving place with a long memory and celebrities misusing their position may find themselves incredibly unpopular and out of work once this time has passed Evangeline Lilly for instance has been outspoken in the past about how she won t alter her current lifestyle going as far as to downplay and politicize the outbreak She has since apologized for her remarks though only time will tell whether the masses will opt for forgiveness Sadly Hollywood legends are predominantly made up of people over the age of fifty Just take a moment and think about your favorite actors or artists I m guessing a significant number will be skewed towards the older demographic As depressing as it is brace yourself for a few famous faces to pass away this year This is when the severity and non negotiability of this virus will finally sink in for those who are still dubious about this entire pandemic Death is the great equalizer everyone must experience one day whether rich or poor famous or unknown no matter their beliefs or lifestyle Studios Cinemas and the Rise of Indie Film With many cinemas forced to close across the country film studios are faced with a massive financial conundrum Tentpole features like Disney s Mulan are nicknamed as such because they are the production that raises enough funds to prop up the rest of the film projects within the company Once again we re now living in an upside down world where these big budgeted blockbusters are now seen as black holes of debt they were incredibly expensive to make and now there s no clear way to obtain that return on investment For the films already out in theaters with their runs cut short due to closures studios were quick to make them available as video on demand VOD as a way to still capitalize on their hype and marketing strategies Yet there are a number of problems with this method The biggest issue revolves around the fact the outbreak will peak at different times for different areas With tent pole features relying on overseas markets more it is important to note not every country has needed to close their theaters Even within the United States there might come a time where some places will be fine to reopen whilst it won t be recommended in other areas Take Onward for example As a kid s film its release in Australia was being held back until the April school holiday period Yet as cinemas closed across the United States and the film was plonked on VOD Australian theaters had to quickly organize preview screenings Why Because piracy sadly exists As soon as a film moves online it risks being stolen and distributed without permission worldwide This is devastating for cinemas why would you risk contracting a potentially deadly virus when you can see something for free in the safety of your own home and cuts into the profits of studios So VOD is not the answer to everything though the question remains as to how long production companies and distributors can last before they need to see some kind of return for their hefty film product There are two timelines being bandied about the industry although both are completely arbitrary Judging from what happened in Wuhan China even though other countries might have different experiences it seems places will regain some semblance of normalcy within three months whilst other theorize it ll still take an additional three months for confidence to return to the market and for people to attend the cinema once more That is why a lot of studios have opted to postpone their releases within a three to six month time frame even though this schedule appears to be more of a result of wishful thinking as the pandemic worsens Regardless of how long things will actually take it does seem there ll be an uneasy time when theaters do finally reopen If it s simultaneous across the States then some studios will be quick to drop one of their blockbusters and hope for a quick return as it s not ideal for all the tent pole features to be competing for release dates among a crowded schedule But what if for example cinemas in Texas reopen and those in Washington state remain closed A half online and half theatrical release would only invite piracy and cut into profits The Blumhouse Model With the world turned upside down studios may quickly realize their tent pole features may not be the answer and instead look for low budget productions to ease their pain Blumhouse has been doing this for a while creating content on small budgets so even if the films perform poorly they still make a profit even with mediocre attendance Fantasy Island for instance had a million budget and generated million at the box office It was also made in only a few months Disney will no doubt flick through their forgotten film production library theatrically releasing films that were caught up in the Fox merger like what happened with Underwater Every studio has a few risky completed projects in their proverbial closet and with little to lose they might see how they perform should nationwide releases be an impossibility and where limited screenings are the only way forward What if cinemas reopen but the studios decide to hold back their films in hope for a better time Or if they decide to release on VOD What can theaters show when there s no new content Speaking with my brother who works for a subscription TV service made me realize both television stations and cinemas face the same dilemma How does one make old content feel new Both have potential access to a wide library but will need to play to their niches For theaters expect to see a resurgence in the old drive in format It s both a novelty and oddly succeeds at keeping viewers quarantined easing people s paranoia With streaming services eating away at the market the last few years cinemas have needed to rely on the spectacle of their big screens Films like Avatar and Gravity especially in their D format make use of every inch of that screen that is otherwise squandered on something smaller Right before Australian cinemas closed and after the moment most Hollywood blockbusters pulled their upcoming line up what remained were European UK based productions Bollywood films and local talent Whilst American audiences have never really taken to foreign cinema should Hollywood snub theaters during the first few chaotic weeks of theaters reopening across the States in favour of online distribution then expect movies like The Secret Garden to enjoy the spotlight on the silver screen This is an excellent time for independent filmmakers Whilst rare successful micro budget feature films do exist with The Blair Witch Project Paranormal Activity and The Endless being prime examples If a small time director managed to complete their low budget feature before the lockdown then they could be in luck as distributors might be keen to snap them up and secure a deal Their Finest and the Narratives of the Next Age Their Finest is a movie about filmmaking during a very turbulent time in history Their Finest is a fascinating period drama that s set during World War II and details the struggles of an almost abandoned film industry It s a story that touches on many things but one aspect that stands out is the fact art never stops even during the darkest times the show must go on Studios may be closed but millions of creatives are sitting at home and if they re not currently making something then they re certainly planning their next masterpiece They are chomping at the bit and as soon as humanly possible there will be an explosion of talent and creative expression I m so excited to see what narratives will come out of this time period Make no mistake just as many films say set in WWII in their loglines so too will this moment we re in now be a defining time frame in human history It s easy to see the documentary genre will continue to flourish I ve already seen three different directors requesting people to film their days in isolation hoping to collate the footage It s a genre that can be easy and cheap to produce and lower cinematic quality is usually forgiven more so compared to fictional stories There s also a lot of footage In case you haven t noticed journalism hasn t been shut down and the lucky people working on news crews are the few that still have a guaranteed job within the film industry So it s not a question as to whether documentaries will be made rather it s going to be more about how to stand out from the crowd There will be an entire smorgasbord of COVID documentary entries into future film festivals and critics will tire of them very quickly but only the most unique will become successful Picture from Unfriended Horror films self recorded pieces found footage genre flicks and stories set in one location might see an immediate future in the film industry Another staple genre is horror People turn to scary movies as a way to cope process and understand their own fears regarding current events and the inevitability of death This is why virus related films are suddenly gaining popularity such as the thriller Contagion whilst zombie flicks are experiencing their second wind Whether there ll end up being a spate of What if scenario films based off this time period you can bet every post apocalyptic movie made from here on out will contain an inside joke about toilet paper Horror movies often have small budgets and frequently succeed in getting large returns Don t be surprised if you see yet another entry to the Unfriended series as it would actually be fairly easy to film even whilst in lockdown Found footage style films have fallen out of fashion in recent years though being stuck in isolation may offer a new perspective and bring life to the sub genre once again Maybe this time around they won t all be about ghosts and demons and rather focus on other fears concerning isolation domestic violence and agoraphobia They may even start to bleed into different genres and we might see a wave of one set location dramas using this cinematic style Yet for every person that wants to seek out more information about current events there are also those that are completely over it There s always that other side of coin though the question will be what type of film will balance out the current horrors of the world Traditionally that spot is reserved for superhero movies with Superman famously gaining popularity as a beacon of hope after the horrors of the second World War Yet this sub genre is already looking fairly well worn and very expensive given studios will be trying to dig their way out of a financial crisis if they can at all It may even be foolish to rely on these types of films for much longer Once this is over there will definitely be a pre coronavirus and post coronavirus set of ideologies When people have lost their livelihoods teetered or plunged into a world of poverty or worse have personally lost loved ones are superficial comic book heroes fighting against vapid threats really going to cut it anymore Will people yearn for something more visceral more real Before this virus hit the Western world was a vastly affluent yet bored civilization marred by unscientific philosophizing and dictated to by an outrage culture Now that COVID has dominated the news headlines and sucked air away from other issues only the most important problems in the past will survive in such an anaerobic environment Hollywood in particular has been accused of pandering to certain demographics and subsequently alienating the masses labelled as being too out of touch from time to time If they re not careful in adjusting their narratives to suit the current times then they risk being deemed irrelevant and will lose their market share to the indie and foreign filmmakers a sector typically seen to preference a genuine exploration of the art form as opposed to creating films as a business venture at the forefront This is evident in the resonance of the critically popular film Parasite and the surprise popularity of Netflix s newest Spanish movie The Platform The Platform released at the perfect time Yet for every deeply cynical drama there will be a light hearted family film that will take the edge off the horrors of the world I also predict we ll see a resurgence in the romance genre Having been pushed to one side over the last decade to make room for big budget spectacle flicks a Renaissance of sorts is starting to take hold with the modestly popular latest retellings of Little Women and Emma Wanting to save money studios won t always opt for period romance narratives so hopefully we ll come across some original tales regarding love in the coming future After all it is said a plague tends to be followed by a period of great altruism Let s all hope love will be in the air Get ready for some long distance romances Film Festivals Vs Online Streaming Services When I cancelled my own film production my immediate instinct was to try and scramble together a Plan B to film a narrative that could be accomplished within the restrictions of an ever approaching pandemic so I could still enter the film festival I admired Yet as every day passed the more I found my expectations and dreams were being stripped away and eventually I found myself asking Will there even be a film festival Even the prestigious Cannes Film Festival has now been postponed Meanwhile for those events that can many have scrambled to adapt to an online submission and program This is a turning point in the film industry because there has been a rather elitist mentality about what really constitutes as cinema There was essentially a war between movies that had gained theatrical releases verses those that debuted online with Cannes and notable directors leading the charge wanting to preserve the tradition of the collective experience gained by watching stories on the silver screen Try as they may Netflix gained a reputation for producing lower quality productions causing a rift in the industry as to whether their films should be included for submission particularly when sometimes the rules for eligibility were measured by its theatrical release data Now the tables have turned and the vulnerabilities of the traditional cinema format have been exposed The benefits of online streaming are clear for all to see Netflix is taking the time to upend the industry s biases creating a sense of good will by devising a million virus relief fund to financially compensate registered filmmakers after all it s also in their best interest to ensure there are still artists at the end of all this It s fair to expect the industry won t be so uppity in the coming months Whilst the glamour of most film festivals will be lost when they re forced to convert to an online format they may actually become more accessible SXSW s Short Film entrants have been given new life online after having their screenings cancelled and are now available to watch for free thanks to Mailchimp Meanwhile distributors will no doubt be trawling through online film festival finalists hoping to pick up a bargain that will eventually recoup their costs Don t be surprised if you stumble across a festival that s been specially made for movies created during this time in self isolation What About That Dark Shadowy Place Like Simba you must never go there There is one genre that hasn t been discussed yet and that is adult entertainment Whilst we at GUG certainly do not condone its consumption these are interesting times that have brought about a new sense of analysis With most adult productions being produced in Los Angeles and Las Vegas they are currently unable to make content just like other studios Yet this isn t the first time this offshoot of the film industry has been shut down because of a health crisis They have famously been locked down in the past due to HIV scares which from then on has lead to stringent testing measures of cast members conducted on a fortnightly basis Obviously due to the nature of viral infections and the lack of testing kits this system doesn t work with COVID Yet the real tension exists within the old age war between the professionals and the amateurs Prior to the invention of the Internet the adult entertainment industry belonged only to magazine publishers and other regulated sources Though when the average person s bandwidth expanded their kingdom was suddenly lost to anyone with the ability to record and upload footage In order to differentiate from the masses the official industry needed to specialize and sadly this greatly contributed to the rise of the sexualization of violent acts against women among other things Soon there developed an arms race of sorts for who could produce the most wild degrading content though the official industry was still reigned in by rights and regulations and prided themselves on their sense of community The point is this is an industry that doesn t want to see their sense of control slip away even further I mention all of this because this pandemic might present a turning point that raises a number of pressing issues and interesting questions You see COVID is quickly becoming the hottest search term on porn sites bizarrely in major outbreak areas like Washington state and New York City Yep You read that right it really shouldn t shock us to learn there s always someone finding pleasure in someone else s tragedy Yet what this does is essentially date the footage which will inevitably open a can of worms First will we start to see the production companies in LA and Las Vegas call out distributors such as PornHub for hosting content that s abhorrent unethical and unsafe This content will be like rubbing salt in a wound Here they have shut down during a time when the demand for content has arguably never been higher and coupled with the fact many members of their own industry might be tempted to go rogue due to financial distress it stands to reason studios might be irritated enough to put their foot down even if it s a case of the pot calling the kettle black Second will this emerging viral pandemic sub genre break porn s alluring fantasy element or rather the viewer s suspension of disbelief There are several aspects to this The science regarding porn consumption is out and the majority of it is bad news for viewers Though just how studies linking smoking and cancer are largely ignored so too do addicts seemingly disregard the findings about the damaging effects of porn But there s another emerging anti porn argument and that centers around its ethics The Christopher Johnson case made headlines late last year when a missing teen was found on adult entertainment sites Crimes such as sex trafficking are mistakenly seen as a foreign faraway issue whilst people have a tendency to compartmentalize violence on screen compared to violence in real life So when this case came to light it shook the industry as it struck too close to home raising the point as to whether porn is a product that can ever be ethically verified or consumed Similarly now with the emergence of COVID themed adult entertainment will this also hit too close to home It would be interesting to rummage through the data and see if it s a popular search term in Italy a population currently surrounded by death where citizens can personally witness the army trucks drive down their streets removing the hundreds of corpses from medical facilities on a daily basis Instead of arousing will this sub genre simply be seen as tasteless This is coupled with a growing sense of uncoolness where people are justifiably quick to slam those not taking the virus seriously If there are adult productions that blatantly ignore social distancing rules or news surfaces that the people in these videos do contract COVID it essentially further breaks down that mental barrier between fantasy and reality causing society to see this form of entertainment as less of an issue of informed consent but rather as irresponsible and exploitative There s also the Double Mumbo Jumbo factor to consider as coined by screenwriter Blake Snyder It goes back to mental compartmentalization A classic example is with supernatural themed movies A story can feature demons and ghosts as they re somehow considered related but if you suddenly add in aliens as well then it s too much for an audience to suspend their disbelief Notice how Supernatural has featured every monster under the sun except for extra terrestrials With adult entertainment it seems any bodily function is perfectly acceptable but if you add a virus illness sickness to the mix will it have the Double Mumbo Jumbo effect Like the infamous erotic scenes in The Room it seems there is a fine line between arousal and disgust so will this produce the ick factor Lastly it s clear that during this pandemic and forced isolation people will fall victim to their vices The studies have shown there s a novelty factor regarding the nature of arousal over exposure to repeated material over time will dull a person s tastes and physiological response Putting everything together now does this mean people will not only be possibly grossed out and ethically conflicted but also eventually find it boring as well Is it possible to overwhelm and burn through an addiction until it loses its appeal The reason I bring all of this up is because this might be a rare moment for Christians to raise these sorts of issues and concerns surrounding pornographic culture Whether that s bringing further light to the horrors and immediacy of sex trafficking or modelling a better more productive way to spend time or conduct relationships or to check in and catch people before they fall further in their addiction We must be ready We must keep a close eye on this industry not literally but following the news surrounding it so when the opportune time comes we re able to be the light away from this dark shadowy place Film Criticism and the Future Direction of GUG s Movie Reviewers It goes without saying if there s a decrease in film content being produced then there s less for a film critic to critique Newspaper columnists will be the most impacted since they focus solely on new releases Yet for bloggers both of the written kind like at Geeks Under Grace or through video sites like YouTube there s more freedom regarding content We re lucky that not only has the cinematic art form been around for over a hundred years but we re also living in a time when we can easily access past classics from the comfort of our living rooms Suffice to say there are still plenty of films to watch and therefore review At GUG while it is no longer possible to write such articles like the monthly Boom Bust or Meh predictions since it relied on theatrical releases and box office data we will still endeavor to critique and analyze films through a Christian lens As everything has been moving more online my church has been challenging the congregation as to how believers can continue to go out into the world when it s now physically not possible What does John now look like when it says As the Father has sent me I am sending you The key might be related to purposefulness This can be hard to find in an unstructured environment so it s best to start with building some small scale habits As mentioned previously in this article this is a time when people will naturally fall victim to their vices As a film critic if there s anything I m an expert in it s watching movies As amazing as it sounds let me tell you sitting in one spot and watching film after film begins to feel gross after a while Once you view over a hundred a year it s also apparent the vast majority of films are simply mediocre not fantastic but not utterly awful either This humdrum can quickly lead to fatigue constant dissatisfaction and depression if you re not aware of these pitfalls This doesn t mean you shouldn t watch movies far be it from me to recommend such a thing Just aim to be purposeful about your day and the way you approach your film selection otherwise you might feel lost in a sea of mundane and pointless narratives Check out the IMDB top the American Film Institute s lists or if you re feeling particularly bleak go through the Movies You Must See Before You Die book whose title now brings on a whole new meaning Mix it up Don t merely watch things for the sake of passing the time Setting goals having aims or working through lists continues a sense of discipline we may have lost in our current situation and is a trait typically required when it comes to following God We re here at GUG to help guide you through your decisions on what parts of the media are worth engaging in whilst movie based Bible Studies assist in breaking down and separating the muck from the thematic gold if there is any to be found Since we ve always been an online community our presence is unhindered so be sure to make use of our resources and reach out if you need help clarification or are otherwise looking for a community and we ll do our best to assist you during this difficult time Aside from watching copious amounts of movies which I don t recommend doing all day if it s not your job be sure to take breaks from the screen Exercise Darebee features several superhero themed workouts none of which require equipment Now s also the chance to up your skill levels Try out new foods and recipes If you re wanting to get into the film industry start trying out free editing software creating a voice over reel or otherwise experiment and complete those things that have always been on your to do list Don t be afraid to grieve about society s changes from time to time it s natural to want to decompress every so often Trust me watching film after film does get a bit gross after a while The whole reason is that the idea of being sent implies a destination which therefore acknowledges purposefulness and requires discipline I m finding myself constantly surrounded overwhelmed grieved and distracted by the news of COVID though by designating a set time in the day to reflect upon God s Word and pray I try not to lose sight that everything is still within God s provenance By finding structure and purpose within the day I ve discovered the fog of all the hours blurring into one has lifted good habits are developing and I m finding myself becoming more open to God s input This might be a season of reflection or self improvement or God might put on your heart to reach out and find ways to care for those that are otherwise forgotten whether it s through donation drives phone calls to check in on others or even by spreading the importance of just staying home as hard as it surprisingly might be After all there is still an underlying ugliness when people speak about this virus How it only affects those that are old or already have health issues and even though there a more cases popping up every day that challenge this notion it still conjures up images of people already on the road to death as though their lives no longer matter The statement is dismissive in its very nature reeking of ableism Scripture has always cared for the least of these Matthew whether it s through the Old Testament laws that remind farmers not to harvest all the crops and to leave food for those less fortunate Jesus actions of interacting with those suffering from leprosy or Paul directly addressing and acknowledging women when it was culturally uncouth at the time An individualistic apathetic it won t affect me mentality contradicts the entire overarching narrative of Scripture We re all challenged as Christians to try and help those in need and if all that means is staying indoors then it shouldn t be viewed as a meaningless reaction Our choice to self isolate should be seen as the front line assault on this pandemic not the hospitals So in summary keep in contact with God We may feel hopeless in the fact all we re doing is staying at home but we must find contentment in what little we can control and leave the rest to the Lord No need to feel guilty if you are enjoying yourself and catching up on the films you ve always wanted to see as by restricting yourself to your home you are indeed helping those most vulnerable in our communities which is in line with God s commands Just be aware of your personal vices and keep them in check Remember to be purposeful and not lose the trait of discipline and if God presses on you to be sent in other ways that still abide by current health advice then be sure to listen Lastly even though we re not reviewing many new releases during these uncertain times we at GUG are still here for you should you need us Don t be afraid to reach out to your fellow geeks Stay safe and be sure to live long and prosper The post

If you swipe, you'll see there are also some semi-essential amino acids, those are essential for infants and children but cease to be so for adult individuals. Whatever this classification says, you should introduce with your diet boh essential and nonessential amino acids, even though the latter can be made up by your body. This is because of the fact that the process of making those , one being the lack of carbs in your diet. . In Italy, it is recommended that adults introduce at least 1g per kg of protein per day. This number increases for people who workout, pregnancy and breastfeeding but BUT BUT it MUST be associated with an increment of your daily water intake or otherwise you can say goodbye to your kidneys! More of this --> üçóü•ìüç≥ equals more of this --> ‚õ≤üíß or else --> ‚ö∞Ô∏è Jokes aside üòÇ be careful when eating a lot of protein especially if it's animal protein: the saturated fats that come with it can lead to a very high risk of having issues with you cardiovascular system (strokes and atherosclerosis, for instance) ü§î But what if you eat too little protein?

5927,5927,Senator Bernie Sanders berated his staff forced female staffers to sleep in the same rooms as men exposed them to sexual harassment spread hate allied with terrorists all to win two elections he lost The only thing the socialist got out of his failed campaigns was membership in the percent That and memories of flying around the country and the world on private jets and his three homes and bulging bank accounts paid for by an army of gullible idiots who believed in his cause more than he did Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren could be locking up the Democrat nomination right now Instead they wasted million and lost to a crooked senile hack who can barely complete a sentence The two socialist candidates had raised the most money directly and through PACs million for Bernie million for Warren had the most passionate supporters and the best media coverage Why then did these two sprightly septuagenarian socialists lose Because they re socialists Socialists believe in redistributing other people s things but fiercely cling to their own The greediest people in the world are lefties The two socialist senators were full of big ideas for what to do with other people s money but don t touch their homes and their millions And don t redistribute their voters When other Democrats dropped out and united behind Biden Bernie and Warren couldn t make way for each other Even when Warren dropped out she refused to endorse Bernie dooming him to defeat Bernie and Warren were running on the same basic issues When Warren refused to endorse Bernie it was a suicide bombing that not only blew up his campaign but took down her own platform with it It wasn t about the issues Bernie and Warren were really motivated by greed and ego Neither Warren nor Bernie could do what all the other candidates in the race did drop out and endorse somebody else The socialists stayed in and doomed each other in a political suicide pact because they were too petty and greedy to overcome their differences for a higher cause That s how socialism dies Socialists pretend that they want everyone else to sacrifice for the greater good but they never do The Soviet Union s Communist leadership reacted to Chernobyl by moving radioactive dairy products away from Moscow and to other parts of the country China s Communist leadership dealt with the coronavirus by lying to their people and to the rest of the world to maintain their regime s credibility The EU has descended into infighting in every crisis from Muslim mass migrant invasions to the coronavirus over who has to make the sacrifices New York City s Mayor Bill de Blasio insisted on going to the gym with an NYPD detail while others were told to practice social distancing Chicago s Mayor Lori Lightfoot decided to get her hair cut even as the city s small businesses were being closed down It s easy for politicians to tell ordinary people to sacrifice while they live it up Masque of the Red Death style during a plague But what happens when a trolley problem of two top socialist politicians arrives and they have to decide which of them makes the sacrifice for the greater good The answer is deeply revealing Socialist leaders won t sacrifice for each other Not for the sake of their cause Or for anything Ideology didn t unite Bernie and Warren Instead one by one the two socialist politicians were forced to drop out leaving both of them alone with nothing Socialism doesn t unite us It divides and isolates us Like the Chinese Communist virus Socialism doesn t work because instead of the noble altruistic leaders the ideology calls for it actually attracts meanspirited and greedy control freaks who use it to set up their own private fiefdoms Once implemented actual socialism never turns into a utopia of angels disdainful of materialism but descends into a hell of demons who fight each other over the last stale cookie on a tarnished plate That s why idealistic revolutions end in cycles of purges fueled by ego malice and greed Bernie and Warren couldn t put each other up against a wall so they had to settle for the next best thing He brought down her campaign and then she brought down his campaign Neither would serve in heaven and won t even have the opportunity like Milton s Satan or Stalin and Mao to rule in hell Before the two of them become footnotes in electoral history there is a question they should answer How dare they demand that everyone else sacrifice for the greater good when neither of them would Where did these two socialists get the chutzpah to lecture Americans on everything from how much deodorant they use to how much taxes they pay Where is their commitment to redistribution Bernie Sanders quadrupled his net worth since he began plotting to run for president in He made his millions from his national profile And he also used that profile to funnel money to family members Every time he ran for President on a platform of taking away everyone s money he came away richer Why did Bernie take so long to drop out Because even ActBlue idiots wouldn t go on paying for his private jets if he dropped out It took a pandemic and the effective shutdown of the election for the scam to end If it wasn t for the Chinese Virus Bernie would have dragged it out to the last million But there s no private jet flights paid for by ActBlue donors to the Vatican in a pandemic Bernie s campaign slogan Not Me Us was the biggest lie since Hope and Change It was always about Me It was about Bernie his book deals his houses his private jets his interviews and his fame At his age he knows that he will probably never run again and never cash in again None of that makes Bernie a hypocrite Worse It makes him a socialist Bernie Sanders has spent his entire miserable life figuring out a way to make money without working The socialist lifestyle of collective farms wasn t for him He wanted to get into politics because he s lazy narcissistic a control freak abusive greedy and incompetent Those character traits left him with two options Hollywood and Washington D C And Bernie is a bad actor who can only memorize a few lines His career was built on pandering to the same radicals when he first got into politics and when he tried to crawl into the White House Along the way he completely changed his views on any number of issues from immigration to gun control But he never stopped figuring out how to cash in on his politics And now he s done it Bernie leaves his great socialist crusade as a percenter a millionaire with three homes despite accomplishing absolutely nothing Socialism isn t real for ordinary people but it s real for socialists Not Me Us Bernie claimed What have the Us gotten out of the Bernie campaign beyond the opportunity to pay for all his stuff The same thing anyone gets under socialism the privilege of paying for the lifestyles of their leaders Socialism isn t about helping people It s about helping socialists Between the two of them Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren brought down the socialist cause But nobody destroys socialism like socialists It was the Communists who really brought down the USSR and if the EU and Communist China s leadership fall to the pandemic it will also be entirely their own doing Lefties have always been the great destroyers of their own movements Bernie and Warren followed in that proud tradition sacrificing their own movement to their greed and egos and leaving the dumpster fire of their campaigns with millions in book payments from the very corporations that they condemn And if you think they were a grifting disaster wait until Rep Alexandria Ocasio Cortez runs for president Daniel Greenfieldis a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the David Horowitz Freedom Center This article previously

After the fact I went to change the colors and found out that there is no choice of colors other then the Ice Blue. Its stupid cause Ford still lists the feature as ""Ambient Lighting' but omits the color changing part on the window sticker now. Long story short, I didn't get my color changing feature and 19's only come in blue. Ambient Lighting does not mean changing colors and that`s why as you said it was omitted on the window sticker. Ambient, and in this case ""Ambient Lighting"" only means ""Immediate Surrounding"" of something."

Or is this all thanks to COVID?-------So like many of you, I ordered my iPad Pro (12.9"" 128 gb, wifi, space grey) with the free Airpods online and was hit with a delivery date 6 weeks from my purchase date. 1 week later, I see that it's in stock at my local store. I decided NOT to order online for pickup and instead just run to the store because: 1) I already had the airpods delivered 2) I wanted to make sure I could get a refund before buying another iPad.Once at the store, I lined up and the usher outside asked me what I wanted, blah blah. I told her. She asked for my full name and said she would reserve it for me. Once inside, I was again asked for my full name. Then the girl asked how she could help me today. I told her the same thing that I told the girl outside. She said ""Sorry we're out of stock but we have silver in 256 gb "" I gave in because I wasn't about to wait 6 weeks.I realized once getting home that the employees outside don't communicate w/ the employees inside and I totally missed my reservation. I guess it's my fault for not letting the 2nd girl know. I checked online and all the stores in my province are yet again out of stock on all iPad Pros.TLDR; I'm stuck with a silver iPad that doesn't match my space grey Macbook because I don't know how Apple stores work lol.Guess I should stick to Best Buyüò≠"

7447,7447,Hello everyone First and foremost I will provide context as to not keep this introduction confusing I have dissociative identity disorder One of my other main alters within my system made a forum account here back in He never made any additional posts besides the old intro post he made with the old account that year I decided to make a new account today and deleted that old one I came on here for the first time in YEARS since he s been on here because I was organizing my browser s bookmarks These were bookmarks dating back from I curiously opened up the website I felt compelled to join seeing that the community is active As for me I go by the name Violet I am a nonbinary bisexual trans person who uses She Her pronouns I am the Host alter of my DID system which means I handle everything and am fronting the most I have quite a handful of other alters in my system but usually it is me who is fronting and Victor who is co conscious with me Victor is the one who made the account in Most people in my life all know I have DID at this point and have actually met Victor before me quite longer We are currently years of age collectively I went through a lot of extensive counseling and therapy for my DID and a slew of other things like PTSD for quite a number of years and it s been a long difficult journey I have gone through a history of domestic violence and abuse throughout my life and in childhood so I really feel others will be able to connect to me I also would like to share my own unique experiences here in time hopefully My other main alter in my system is Victor and he used to be on testosterone injections for a few years he was the one born into the body and was fronting more so his gender presentation is very different as he considered himself more transmasculine he had short blonde hair dressed in men s clothing Currently today I have very long violet purple hair and really love makeup I began fronting more prominently and it s been a few years since I have not been on testosterone as I had come to an agreement with Victor not to be on it this was extremely hard but we worked it out I see myself as a more feminine expressing alter Victor used to previously be in a long term commitment in the past but for a few years now I have been single and thriving Being a trans person with DID is an incredible struggle but I have been investing myself within these past two years trying to create stronger inner communication This year I am determined to create a path of healing with the rest of my alters As for more fun facts about myself I work in management do modeling work and projects on the side and am a spirit worker I very much love the metaphysical and have found that has greatly helped me throughout these past few years I do not consider myself Pagan but I consider myself a practitioner I am also Asian Korean Vietnamese Chinese and so would love to connect with other folks on here from different backgrounds Thank you if you read through my intro and I am happy to be here

9527,9527,Title Preface This is not a scholarly work Although I may be presenting original thoughts I claim no responsibility for the academic or research related content of this book I have relied solely on others work in my research My purpose is to create something that is accessible thought provoking personal insightful and above all accurate I would say true but that term is pregnant with the twins Arrogance and Finality I not only tolerate but urge you to check my work I fear nothing here as you will either confirm or contradict my assertions and at worst evoke challenges to my thoughts and assumptions No harm no foul My strength has always been the written word Put me in a live debate and I ll lose to the most amateur debater Indulge me as I lay down what I feel is a careful and at times whimsical approach to the subject matter I hope above all that the material I present is respected for its reality It is real to me Though as I stated above I am no academic I would claim the title intellectual Absurd as it is to invoke percentages in this context my reasoning in the exit of my former faith has been based on intellectual and on emotional considerations As it relates to an understanding of the world I have always savored objectivity I prefer non fiction literature and only dabble in fiction There is enough wonder to explore in the facts of the physical and philosophical universes that I find it wearisome to consume large quantities of purely imaginative content This is not to discount fiction s value I simply want to convey my respect for the actual I urge you to lower your guard relax and enjoy this writing without forming defenses There will always be time for that Introduction There is great power and potential in asking yourself in naked honesty Is it possible I am or have been wrong about It is axiomatic that if you ask yourself that question you have a stronger claim on truth or correctness than one who has not asked it all other things being equal u spiritualies It s the questions you re afraid to ask that need to be asked the most u spiritualies Have you started with the answer or the question How you answer that question will determine the validity of the outcome of your inquiry u spiritualies These three quotes could probably be combined into one The heart of the matter is epistemology that is how do we know what we know There are many methods for determining what information is credible By removing biases and the emotional element from the question most people can fairly easily agree on the relative strengths and weaknesses of these different methods These methods include Science hypothesis experiment conclusion etc Appeal to authority Emotion Philosophy Tradition Experience Guessing Revelation I would rather have questions that can t be answered than answers that can t be questioned This is the major difference between science and religion For the purposes of this work I am going to forego any significant discussion of religion in general in favor of specific discussion of Mormonism because it is my experience It is also suited to objective critique and examination more so than older more traditional religions In the interest of full disclosure I am atheistic subtype apatheist That is I have a high degree of confidence in my assessment that there is no god Furthermore if I am wrong I am unwilling to submit myself to or worship any god which cannot or refuses to make itself known in a realistic way to one who is ethical and open to evidence If I am wrong about god I am in good company according to any meaningful examination of the statistics No particular religion in the history of humankind has a large enough share of the marketplace to claim an acceptably high effectiveness for an omnipotent being s product Everybody is a non believer in everybody else s god Take Mormonism for an example Of all the humans who have ever lived some significant percentage of them have believed in monotheism let us for the purposes of this exercise call this Abrahamic religion For roughly years there was Abrahamic religion but no Mormonism so all those people were wrong Since the percentage of the world s population that has embraced Mormonism strongly enough to be baptized is extremely small on the order of Of those let s say half have remained active Of those let s say are keeping at least a terrestrial standard of obedience Of those let s say are living celestially Even that is probably a high estimate all things considered Of those let s say half are worthy of the highest level of the celestial kingdom Of course these are absurd calculations but they still reflect the criticism The bottom line is that if Mormonism is true then the overwhelming majority of folks have been fooled or neglected I would have to be included in the fooled category because not only did I have every opportunity to accept Mormonism but I was raised in indoctrinated and indoctrinated others in its tenets And then I turned away Apostatized Rejected it No invective is too hurtful to describe my status in terms of the Gospel If Mormonism is the way I m screwed On top of all this there are no two identical Mormons in terms of how they view their religion as I already addressed What level of concordance does there have to be in order for two people to have the same religion On my way out of Mormonism I have never lost the awareness of the fact that I m screwed if I m wrong So how can I be an apatheist What about Pascal s Wager What if I m wrong Again the gravity of the situation is not lost on me So what of it First Pascal s Wager is quite a desperate proposition and betrays the feebleness of the Mormon message again we re sticking with Mormonism here Why would God feel the need to employ this particular threat let s be honest that s what PW is to persuade me to believe Like so much of Mormonism I m left wondering where God s fingerprints are All I see are men s If we compare God our Heavenly Father to what we typically count as worthy attributes of an earthly father he receives pretty poor marks in several areas What kind of father hides himself from his kids Does a good father require unearned blind trust or does he give his children instruction using logical reasoning and a consistent approach That is not the way the Mormon version of Heavenly Father shakes out You can t pin him down on anything Consider the following ideas together in their Mormon context and try to make sense of it challenges to the idea are in parentheses The Holy Spirit guides how do you know what the Spirit is ie not just emotion Follow the Prophet which prophet why is today s prophet better than yesterday s if God is the same across time The Gospel is simple and easy to understand we re not meant to understand everything hence the need for faith My ways are higher than your ways but we are created in His image and sometimes His ways are downright evil if we look at the record Beware of pride kind of a catch all way of saying just obey and don t ask questions Whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants it is the same why the middlemen Philosophies of men mingled with scripture if this is so evil as to be denounced in the temple as Satanic why does the modern church fit this description so perfectly Revelation will never contradict true science only it does ALL the time Surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets what purpose is served by having large chunks of history occupied by people who have no access to prophets then God created our souls including our brains and endowed us with ability to reason but then He warns us not to rely too heavily on these things like it s dangerous If any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God who giveth to all men liberally but usually not He s usually really mad at His children just read the scriptures and you ll see that He has an anger issue That was exhausting just to write down There are so many caveats and traps The fingerprints of fallible men are all over these ideas If there were an omnipotent omniscient benevolent father in heaven I have to believe He would deal very differently with us Despite innumerable statements to the opposite effect uttered by apostles and prophets the way to revelation is not simple It definitely isn t easy The authorities often give cookbook style recipes for understanding God s will Spoiler alert it pretty much always circles back to trusting the Brethren No matter what else finds its way into the equation the poison pill is their authority Not God s not the Holy Ghost s not logic not reason not your innate sense of morality and ethics Just their word And on a superficial juvenile level that might be acceptable IF they were as righteous and in tune as we ve been led to believe Credibility and trustworthiness matter when we re being required to order our lives around the pronouncements of a small group of men Even the Church s teachings require that prophets and indeed all priesthood holders be men of impeccable integrity and uprightness Joseph Smith s character matters a great deal in the context of and by decree of Mormonism itself He alone was present at the First Vision He alone saw the angel Moroni He pronounced a great deal of revelations which we are exhorted to bind ourselves to at the peril of our salvation If his character is shady if his behavior reveals dishonorable deeds of an extreme severity if his words are shown to largely be deceptive on an objective basis then ought we not obligate ourselves to discard his teachings in favor of more reliable and credible sources I will give numerous examples of each of these problems his character behavior and words in the following pages Here I inscribe a line in the sand This is the first goalpost See that it remains unmoved Chapter One Goalposts We ve got to define what it is we re talking about when we say Mormonism Mormonism defined A system of beliefs about this life the Premortal Existence and the destiny of our souls afterward A church claiming moral authority and making claims of truth A comprehensive way of interpreting the world its people customs behaviors laws philosophies attitudes and events and oneself Mormonism is not one discrete entity Just as there are no two identical humans there are no two identical Mormons It is fair to say that there are as many Mormonisms as there are Mormons Former Mormons or non Mormons who have heard about it That being said there are some aspects of Mormonism that are extremely prevalent and I will focus here on the elements most traditional or orthodox Mormons tend to agree on I state things here in a way that is intended to be a clear and accurate representation with as little ambiguity as possible The points are numbered for reference not to assign any particular hierarchy of significance on them Nothing written here carries any intention of tricking the reader and there is no sarcasm or angle in any of these points This is a literal representation of what my beliefs were before x God Jesus and the Holy Ghost are distinct persons and they are of the species Homo sapiens Man is created in God s image God is an exalted or perfected human who had a father He has a wife and so on God is unchangeable in His perfection His benevolence His knowledge and His power God loves His children He is someone we want to emulate in every possible way We indeed have the potential to become exactly as He is becoming exalted to godhood Jesus Christ was the firstborn of God Jehovah of Elohim in the spirit the literal Son of God in the flesh born to a virgin Mary who was a daughter of God I was taught that Mary and Elohim had sex to produce Jesus which is what Brigham Young taught God instituted the Plan of Salvation which provides His children with the chance to gain physical bodies be tested in mortal life and through faith in Jesus Christ be saved and exalted if certain criteria are satisfied We are permitted freedom of choice often given the shorthand term free agency God will not interfere with our free agency God works through prophets in order to dispense knowledge administer the affairs of His kingdom on the earth and preserve and use the priesthood to bless us while on the earth Adam was created as the first man to inhabit the earth and was placed in the Garden of Eden He was married to Eve by Elohim This all happened roughly years ago Adam was the first prophet on the earth and earth has had several gospel dispensations each with prophets and God s church administered by authorized men Prophets are absolutely necessary for general revelation and for investment of priesthood keys on the earth Times when there is no living prophet are referred to as general apostasy the most notable of which was the Great Apostasy from about the deaths of the Apostles through April From the Fall of Adam mankind inherited mortality and a thick veil of forgetfulness which is what requires us to exercise faith and necessitated the Atonement of Jesus Christ There was no death of any creature prior to the Fall I had a nuanced view of this following my time in the BYU life sciences school Physical death was overcome by the Resurrection of Christ All humans will be resurrected Satan is a real being a non embodied spirit child of Elohim who rejected the Plan of Salvation and Elohim Himself He persuaded of the spirits to follow him and forego mortal life electing outer darkness A very small handful of those who came to earth would become Sons of Perdition and be cast into Outer Darkness reigning over Satan forever These are the only ones to endure eternal punishment This is the hell of traditional Christianity Virtually all people who chose mortal life will receive a kingdom of glory so unimaginably wonderful that if we glimpsed it we would be strongly tempted to end our lives to experience even the lowest or Telestial Kingdom God is only good and Goodness only comes from God or His influence Satan is only bad and evil only comes from the influence of the devil We ought to choose to worship God and shun the devil s influence choose the right We can trust the prophets and apostles to lead us in a way that promotes goodness They will never lead us astray Joseph in Egypt prophesied of Joseph Smith s ministry Joseph Smith was on balance a good man and according to the Doctrine and Covenants next to Jesus Christ in importance for the salvation of God s children He had regular sins and weaknesses He was honest upright and loyal The First Vision occurred in the spring of in a grove of trees on the Smith farm It consisted of God and Jesus revealing to Joseph in response to his prayer The reason he was praying was that he wanted to know which church to join because he could not figure it out by his own study His heart was pure and that is one of the reasons God chose him despite his young age The peoples described in the Book of Mormon came to the American continent from Israel the Nephites in BC the Jaredites and Mulekites much earlier Their posterity is present today in large numbers in the form of Native Americans Pacific Islanders and those descended from Incas Mayans Aztecs etc who mixed with white Europeans following the discovery of the New World by explorers The reason black people have dark skin is that they are descendants of Cain The reason American Indians and other Lamanites have darker skin is because God wanted to distinguish between them and the righteous Nephites and to prevent mixing of their seed I tried not to think too much about this and was not personally racist Joseph Smith was persecuted for his claim of being a prophet seer and revelator He was falsely accused of being a charlatan and various other crimes The Book of Abraham is a translation of the writings of Abraham in Egypt The Old Testament is a record of the children of Israel which focuses heavily on their Exodus and wanderings God led them and commanded them via prophets to take the promised land from the previous inhabitants They were justified because they were doing as God commanded Abraham was obedient when God commanded Him to sacrifice Isaac Obedience is the most important aspect of gospel living the first law of heaven We should all strive to have faith and sacrifice everything to follow God Nephi was correct to slay Laban in order for the physical record of the scriptures could be preserved for Lehi and his family posterity Despite the commandment not to murder the voice of the Spirit to Nephi trumped what he thought was moral We should strive to be in tune with the Spirit like Nephi Many things that seem wrong are in fact right if God instructs us so Sexual misconduct is abominable to God and very close to murder in seriousness It is very difficult to receive forgiveness for sexual sins Sexual sins include adultery fornication homosexual relations masturbation pornography petting rape incest bestiality pedophilia and every impure thought or action Modesty is an important way of safeguarding virtue Just like human life virtue is not actually recoverable so the Atonement has some limitation for sins like these Sex is a gift from God and is primarily for procreation Modern understanding also includes enjoyment and expression of love between husband and wife Birth control is permitted though not particularly celebrated Couples should strongly consider having as many children as possible Since the s the emphasis on large families is less strident and dealt with as more of a personal matter Joseph Smith and other early members practiced plural marriage only because God commanded it in very strong terms I was not really aware of Joseph s involvement prior to Plural marriage was instituted to increase the number of spirits born into faithful Mormon households Plural marriage was a way of taking care of widows Plural marriage was not bad for women and had very little to do with carnal appetites When we obey God s commandments we are blessed Tithing is an eternal principle a preparatory practice of the Law of Consecration Most faithful Mormons pay tithing based on their gross income in anticipation of gross blessings vs net It is a principle of faith and financial considerations are only incident to the physical form that it takes We should pay tithing even if it means great sacrifices or consequences When we show this type of faith God will provide for our needs in compensation Temples and the covenants made there are necessary to enable us to return to the presence of God We must gain crucial knowledge and make covenants in the House of the Lord in order for our families to remain together in the eternities Secular or non temple marriage is inferior to sealing performed in the temple We are to wear the temple garment day and night for our entire lives Priesthood blessings have the capacity to heal illness and give direction for our lives if we exercise faith There is no way Joseph Smith could have made up the Book of Mormon as he was uneducated and it testifies of Jesus Christ He translated the Book of Mormon from the Gold Plates using the Urim and Thummim via the gift and power of God He took words engraved on golden plates written in Reformed Egyptian and produced the record we now have as the Book of Mormon Jesus Christ visited the Nephites at the temple in Zarahemla following his resurrection and days and nights of darkness and the destruction and obliteration of many cities These cities were filled with wicked people and were destroyed because they rejected the prophets testimonies of the Savior Jesus called disciples to lead the church that he established among the Nephites He instructed them to call the church after His name Infant baptism is a damnable offense Lehi Nephi Laman Lemuel Jacob Enos Mosiah Amaleki Benjamin Alma Alma Ammon Korihor Mormon Moroni Amulek and all of the other men in the Book of Mormon were actual people The lessons taught through the telling of their stories are calculated to impart wisdom for our day We should never become lax or satisfied with our study of the Book of Mormon The organization of the Church is divine Men hold the priesthood and administer church government because that is the correct role for them Women bear children and this is analogous to the priesthood role for men Women do exercise priesthood in the temple initiatory God does not use public opinion polls to direct the affairs of His church God does not change his mind about His commandments because humans disagree with them We are a peculiar people God s ways are higher than man s ways We believe the teachings of Jesus The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints has the fullness of the Gospel The purest form of Christianity is contained within and promoted by the Church All other denominations are in apostasy although there are many good and well meaning members of other faiths Eventually if one wants salvation one must bow the knee and become Mormon Mormon is synonymous with Christian in its truest sense To reject the message of Mormon missionaries is literally to reject Jesus People with same sex attraction can and must choose to live a celibate and romantically unattached life Even showing sexless affection for someone of the same gender hand holding kissing is considered sinful and not tolerated This is the same as a woman who never has an opportunity to marry in this life Mortality is a short amount of time in comparison with eternity God will sort all of this out but we must live by faith for the outcome to be favorable No one is born gay Homosexual lesbian feelings or relationships and transgender or other gender identities are temptations of the devil the great deceiver this topic has evolved over the years that is following my crisis in x the Church has changed its stance on these things drastically although they are still firmly against homosexual behavior I was in agreement with the Church that even homosexual orientation in the absence of action was sinful Whatever is spoken by the Spirit is scripture Satan is very good at what he does and cunning God is more powerful than Satan Spiritual knowledge is more important than secular knowledge However all things denote there is a god and all truth can be circumscribed in one God is not a respecter of persons and esteems all the same black and white bond and free male and female Obedience is the first law of heaven I wasn t particularly in love with some of the practicalities of this such as on the mission but believed it in principle and made every effort to follow it The only way to become a Son of Perdition is to deny the Holy Ghost This was understood by me as having a certain knowledge or a personal physical witness of Jesus and then betraying him sort of like seeing the sun at noon day and denying it is there The Articles of Faith describe our beliefs The commandments are vital Other commandments include but are not limited to follow the prophet obey your church leaders

as to worthiness now every other year fast monthly be willing to give any thing including life to the Church be humble endure to the end do baptisms for the dead doubt your doubts I didn t really have this quote in my head in but if I had had minor doubts or concerns I certainly would have given the benefit of the doubt to belief be perfect follow the Spirit plant a garden do not entertain doubts or critical questions do not murder or assault others do not commit suicide give receive priesthood blessings and believe in their power treat words of God s servants as the same as the voice of the Lord do not get a vasectomy or tubal ligation unless it is an emergency give your life rather than lose your virtue There may be a temptation to protest and say Remember though we believe in continuing revelation I will just state that that is in the context of this book simply an escape clause If we think of this book as a conversation or heaven forbid a contest between belief and unbelief you must concede that we need a fixed set of sidelines and goalposts If I am not allowed to use logical fallacy in criticism of the Church then it stands to reason that you as a defender ought not be permitted to use that fallacy Some advantages are already baked into the cake for the believer such as being able to say something requires faith or God hasn t revealed the answer to that etc I don t plan on delving into areas of deep obscure doctrine There is plenty of material to cover in areas where the record is clear and unmistakable So much of Mormon apologetics is simply the defense of a mutilated unrecognizable shadow of Mormonism It s easy to defend what you make up on the spot Inappropriate mention of horses in the Book of Mormon Let s just call them tapirs Maybe tapir is Adamic or Reformed Egyptian for horse Book of Abraham translation have nothing to do with words and pictures present on the papyri Joseph was simply inspired by what he saw These are pathetic attempts to refute legitimate criticisms without bringing good evidence to bear Apologists are seen by many including me as nothing more than pious spin doctors If there were acceptable rebuttals to these criticisms of the Church would it not fall to the Special Witnesses of Christ Those we sustain as Prophets Seers and Revelators Like Fezzik and the Holocaust Cloak it just so happens that we have the right tool for the job The only problem is they never speak up in any meaningful way We are served heavy portions of Chicken Soup for the Soul every months a little red meat with plenty of trans fat and nothing to answer the critiques I am going to write about in this book Why is Mormonism different than other Christian denominations Because we have prophets who can speak doctrine and clear up confusion with authority Only they don t Mormon doctrine is about as muddy as it can possibly get It is not internally consistent and it clashes violently with extra Mormon realities I intend to demonstrate both of these glaring problems with many examples Chapter If You Weren t Mormon Already If you weren t Mormon already would you join Let s say you were brought up in a mainline Oldsmobuick plain vanilla type of Christianity Moderately regular church attendance well adjusted to modern life One day the elders knock on your door announcing to you that they have the Restored Gospel of Jesus Christ to share Statistically speaking you d thank them for their time and ask them to please refrain from knocking in the future because you already have a religion For the sake of this exercise let s say you re curious You ve heard of Mormonism but all you know is that you think they have more than one wife You have Mormon colleagues at work who seem like really nice people So what the fetch why not Come on in Let s hear what you ve got to say Elder Jones looks at Elder Smith knowingly glad that they chose to knock on just one more door before curfew They begin laying out the basic truths of the Gospel They say there are prophets on the earth today just like in ancient times and that God s one true church is once again established In your moderately skeptical way you inform them that you feel like there might be more to the story They assure you that what they ve taught is true and you can know for yourself by asking God They have you read Moroni They end with their testimonies of Joseph Smith Jesus Christ and the current prophet Thomas S Monson You go about your life for a few days occasionally pausing to think about the intriguing things those young elders talked about Then it hits you you can ask Google You go to your computer and type in Joseph Smith Mormon prophet The first page is largely Wikipedia articles and links to lds org Then you notice at the bottom of the page Failed prophecies Well it never occurred to you that you could actually know definitively whether Joseph Smith really did what the elders said he did He lived in recent times and there are probably large amounts of corroborating evidence newspapers journals and on and on to piece together what really happened in New York in the early to mid s This leads you into what feels like it could be a never ending investigation Joseph Smith was controversial It seems like everyone has a very polarized opinion of him The Church paints a very clean cut picture of a righteous hero with minimal flaws The born again evangelical Christians say Mormons follow a false prophet and worship a different Jesus The more secular critics seem to agree with the evangelicals insofar as Mormonism s flaws are concerned You decide that with all the claims Joseph Smith made there has to be something that is scientifically or objectively verifiable or falsifiable What this Book of Abraham I thought Abraham was in Genesis Okay Turns out Joseph Smith translated or claimed to translate the Book of Abraham from papyri that he bought from a traveling salesman of Egyptian antiquities along with some mummies He did so before the Rosetta Stone was deciphered so it would stand to reason that if he had the gift and power of God to translate ancient unknown languages the translation he produced would line up with the papyri It doesn t take long for you to find information that dashes this to pieces You check a site called fairmormon org to see what the defenders have to say Maybe they have an explanation

I checked today out of curiosity my oil level as I am driving on the dealer oil change. Two dots on the dipstick without any printing or hash area!! Its well over the upper dot. To me it looks like they over filled it. Not surprising and why I do my own changes. Attention to detail. E [/quote] Toyota dipsticks are horrible, but only part of the problem. The other issue is the dipstick tube itself. When you withdraw the dipstick, it drags oil with it. Wipe, reinsert, withdraw to check, and oil is smeared on the dipstick. It can give a false-high reading. Most accurate result is to remove the stick, wipe it, then wait for 3-5 minutes for the oil to drain back out of the tube, then reinsert and remove the stick to check."

Are you kidding votes Would not surprise me votes What even is this votes I have not even finished the first remake yet votes It is inevitable votes Show Voting Form The game starts with the same FMV as FFVII Remake The camera zooms past the Shin Ra building swooping down to a train approaching the Number Mako reactor We pan down to a familiar looking figure with a large sword strapped to his back But as the camera comes around we see that he has long dark hair and a scar on his cheek Zack Fair is a wise cracking happy go lucky kinda guy and he gets along famously with Biggs Wedge and Jessie but Barret is clearly housing some suspicions about him He s worried about the attention that the famous SOLDIER ST class might draw to his terrorist cell but Barret can not turn down the help of someone as skilled as Zack While strong Zack is not at his prime as he is still recovering from injuries sustained in a recent battle although when pressed Zack laughs it off After successfully detonating the reactor the team escapes via Sector where Zack runs into Aerith The two clearly know each other but before Zack can explain the two are separated by Shin Ra troops with Zack not wanting Aerith to get involved he promises to find her again when he can Zack regroups with Avalanche on the train and rides back to the Sector slums He greets Tifa who gives a pretty cool response but instead of going inside to get paid he heads back to the small apartment Tifa arranged for him Inside he takes care of a barely responsive Cloud who is showing signs of improvement The next day Tifa says that she s busy and to come back for his pay later in the day Zack explores the town helping people out but sees a squad of Shin Ra troopers out looking for someone with his description Jessie convinces him to come along on her mission to secure explosive components She figures his Shin Ra ID may still work seeing as Shin Ra have listed him KIA They raid the Shin Ra warehouse but are confronted by Roche Roche is surprised to see Zack alive After soundly thrashing the lower ranked SOLDIER Zack suggests that Roche join him Roche asks him what happened to his so called honor when the party is crashed by another Avalanche cell Jessie and Zack get away and parachute back down to the slums landing neatly in the square in front of th Heaven Jessie invites him home but Zack declines asking if Jessie has heard of a flower girl called Aerith over in Sector Jessie says that a girl matching his description sometimes sells flowers at the market stalls or the train station Zack returns to th Heaven and Barret asks if he is there for his pay Zack brushes it off and asks if they have any more work coming up Barret says they are going to hit another reactor They proceed through the reactor but are surprised by President Shinra The president is surprised to see Zack still alive and Zack tells him that he can take whatever Shin Ra throws at him He falls off the bridge after the Airbuster fight crashing through the roof of the church and finally re unites with Aerith Reno shows up greets Zack and calls Tseng on the phone Tseng tells Reno to stand down Reno tells them both to watch their backs Aerith and Zack help out people around Sector the two go on a date in Sector and then head home late The pair are confronted by Reno and Rude Tseng has ordered them to bring Zack in for questioning After soundly defeating the pair they head home Aerith is excited to introduce Zack to her mother but Elmyra is concerned about the Turks Elmyra asks Zack to never speak to Aerith again and he says he can not do that but that if anyone wants Aerith they go through him The pair head for Sector but are surprised to see some of Don Corneo s thugs with the the limp form of Cloud strapped across the back of a chocobo headed for Wall Market pursued by Tifa The thugs get away and Zack asks Tifa what happened The thugs attacked the apartments killing Marle and taking that guy from Zack s apartment The trio search the Wall Market for a way to access Corneo s compound eventually acquiring batteries that allow them to power construction machinery to scale the walls They fight their way through Corneo s goons rescue Cloud with Tifa shocked to see her old friend Cloud see s her and speaks her name and then Corneo dumps them all into the sewer but not before revealing that Shin Ra are planning to drop the Sector plate on Zack After all if the army can not do it maybe the plate can finally finish him off They head back to Sector fighting their way up the pillar and Zack stops the Shin Ra forces from detaching the plate Tseng confirms over the phone that Zack and Aerith are present and after a few seconds we see a distant explosion Shin Ra have blown the Sector pillar Our heroes can only watch as the Sector slums the church and Aerith s home are crushed beneath the falling plate The team tries to help the survivors and are contacted by Tseng He apologizes to Aerith and reveals that they have Elmyra captive They will trade her life for Zack and Aerith Zack and Aerith both agree but Barret convinces them on a two pronged rescue plan Zack and Aerith surrender while Tifa Barret Biggs Wedge and Jessie infiltrate the Shinra building We see Cloud struggle to get to his feet and he lifts up the Buster Sword left behind by Zack when he surrendered I am coming too As the team infiltrates the building Zack and Aerith are released from captivity by Kunsel and Luxiere We d hoped the rumors were not true But Hojo s research levels are a shambles Something has made a mess and killed most of the researchers Elmyra is dying and speaks her last few words to Aerith Zack recognizes the swordwork and the machinery that kept Jenova in stasis Zack tells Luxiere and Kunsel to secure an escape route while he goes after Sephiroth Aerith refuses to leave him The two find the President s body slumped over his desk with Masamune pinning him to it Rufus lands on the helipad and Zack fights him one on one but the fight is interrupted by an Avalanche helicopter The heroes make their way down to the garage Luxiere sacrifices himself so that the others can escape A rolling battle down the highway ensues as shinra troops target the convoy of avalanche and defecting soldier personnel Looking out over the vast desert from the edge of Midgar Zack Cloud and Tifa all agree that Sephiroth needs to be stopped

I like money, we all do lets be honest. And this years Christmas blasted my wallet.. \- Not religious nor do I really care for it, I'm atheist I guess. So will I say your religion aint real? Nah, but it's just not for me. \- big ole flirt I guess. Or so I've been told? Idk, learned that recently but if I try to flirt I'm just awkward lmao. Physically I'm 6'2, average weight.

10577,10577,"[SIZE=7][B]Tanzanite: Tanzanian miner becomes overnight millionaire[/B][/SIZE] [IMG] [/IMG] A small-scale miner in Tanzania has become an overnight millionaire after selling two rough Tanzanite stones - the biggest ever find in the country. Saniniu Laizer earned ¬£2.4m ($3.4m) from the country's mining ministry for the gemstones, which had a combined weight of 15kg (33 lb). ""There will be a big party tomorrow,"" Mr Laizer, a father of more than 30 children, told the BBC. Tanzanite is only found in northern Tanzania and is used to make ornaments. It is one of the rarest gemstones on Earth, and one local geologist estimates its supply may be entirely depleted within the next 20 years. The precious stone's appeal lies in its variety of hues, including green, red, purple and blue. Its value is determined by rarity - the finer the colour or clarity, the higher the price.

3618,3618,DOI 6 s12862 Background Measuring the evolutionary rate of reproductive isolation is essential to understanding how new species form Tempo calculations typically rely on fossil records geological events and molecular evolution analyses The speed at which genetically based hybrid mortality arises or the incompatibility clock is estimated to be millions of years in various diploid organisms and is poorly understood in general Owing to these extended timeframes seldom do biologists observe the evolution of hybrid mortality in real time Results Here we report the very recent spread and fixation of complete asymmetric F1 hybrid mortality within eight years of laboratory maintenance in the insect model Nasonia The asymmetric interspecific hybrid mortality evolved in an isogenic stock line of N longicornis and occurs in crosses to N vitripennis males The resulting diploid hybrids exhibit complete failure in dorsal closure during embryogenesis Conclusion These results comprise a unique case whereby a strong asymmetrical isolation barrier evolved in real time The spread of this reproductive isolation barrier notably occurred in a small laboratory stock subject to recurrent bottlenecks Keywords Background Given the importance of determining the patterns that affect the tempo of speciation renewed emphasis has been placed on understanding how fast reproductive isolation barriers evolve during the speciation process In the laboratory complete F1 hybrid mortality has never been documented to evolve de novo while there are a few cases of incomplete premating isolation and a case of hybrid reproduction defects in experimentally evolved yeast In mammals and birds the evolution of strong hybrid mortality takes on average four million and million years respectively In frogs estimates suggest the minimum age for total hybrid inviability to become fixed is million years However incomplete reproductive isolation and or segregating variation for hybrid incompatibles can occur within various species such as Arabidopsis and Tribolium Intraspecific variation in hybrid incompatibilities indicates that there is segregating variation for hybrid incompatibility alleles but it does not inform when the incompatibility factors arose or spread per se Taken together the estimated timespans for severe hybrid mortality to fix in natural populations suggests that its emergence is often slow and or restricted to large populations The genus Nasonia includes four closely related species of parasitic wasps that diverged between to million years ago These species include N vitripennis N longicornis N giraulti and N oneida The latter three species evolved sympatrically within the geographic range of N vitripennis The sister species N giraulti and N oneida occur sympatrically and share a distribution in the North Eastern temperate zone of North America while N longicornis lives in allopatry from N giraulti and N oneida on the western side of the continent All four species are commonly used in laboratory studies of interspecific differences in their genetics phenotypes and microbial symbionts reviewed in Multiple Wolbachia infections exist within Nasonia and cause cytoplasmic incompatibility between the species When reared under the same conditions in and before and cured of their Wolbachia infections N longicornis and N vitripennis produced similar numbers of viable F1 hybrid offspring in comparison to parental controls Fig a Indeed all intraspecific crosses in the Nasonia genus readily produce F1 hybrids in the absence of Wolbachia However hybrid breakdown is commonly observed in the haploid F2 hybrid males wherein cytonuclear incompatibilities and host microbiota interactions cause hybrid larval mortality Fig Diagram of experimental crosses and their outcomes a Interspecific crosses of Nasonia vitripennis and N longicornis strains R3 and UT produce F1 hybrids prior to b An asymmetric postzygotic F1 hybrid lethality arises between N vitripennis strains and N longicornis strain R3 but not with N longicornis strain UT c To test if this asymmetric hybrid lethality is due to a maternal genetic or cytoplasmic effect heterozygous offspring of N longicornis UT R3 and R3 UT were crossed with N vitripennis resulting in approximately survival of F1 hybrid female offspring with both genotypes and cytotypes indicating the hybrid incompatibility is not due to the R3 cytotype d To further test the maternal genetic effect on hybrid mortality N longicornis strains UT and R3 were reciprocally backcrossed to each other resulting in ~ genome replacement into the alternative line s cytotype Females of these strains were then mated with N vitripennis males resulting in the same F1 hybrid lethality observed when the R3 genome was in a UT cytotype IntR3 UT but not when the UT genome was in the R3 cytotype IntUT R3 Recently while attempting to perform experiments on F2 hybrid breakdown between laboratory strains of Nasonia longicornis and Nasonia vitripennis we discovered a novel F1 hybrid lethality between these species Fig b It is asymmetric complete and occurs in the cross between N vitripennis males and N longicornis females This new and unexpected F1 hybrid malady affords an opportunity to time the evolution of postzygotic isolation in the lab and to dissect its genetic basis Here we describe several genetic and developmental analyses that led to timing the spread of this severe F1 hybrid embryonic lethality within eight years of laboratory maintenance Methods Strains All Nasonia wasps were reared in ¬∞C incubators with constant light on Sarchophaga bullata fly pupae hosts raised in the lab All fly hosts were always checked for color and firmness prior to providing them to adult female Nasonia to ensure the quality was sufficient for parasitism This included a dark amber to brown puparium with yellow firm to the touch fly pupae inside approximately days old post egg laying Two strains of N longicornis were used in this study IV7R3 b R3 and NAS NLUT230A UT Strain IV7R3 b is derived from strain IV7 a Wolbachia infected strain that was collected in Utah and antibiotically cured of Wobachia in NAS NLUT230A was collected from a natural population in Utah between and cured of Wolbachia by antibiotic treatment and maintained in the laboratory according to methods described previously Two strains of N vitripennis were used in this study and T Strain was derived from the R511 line collected in New York and cured of Wolbachia through a period of prolonged diapause in The Wolbachia uninfected T strain was derived after antibiotic treatment from strain that harbors a Wolbachia infection and originally derived from R511 The generation time for N longicornis and N vitripennis under these rearing conditions is approximately two weeks Collecting and mating Nasonia All Nasonia stocks were matured into the yellow pupa stage at approximately twelve days of age and then separated according to sex to ensure virginity After pupae eclosion adult wasps were allowed to feed on small amounts of honey For experimental mating crosses one adult male and one virgin adult female Nasonia of the desired strains were each placed into a glass test tube vial that was capped with a cotton plug The pairs were observed for copulation for min After copulation females were provided with honey and one to two hosts depending on the experiment for parasitizing and then incubated under constant light at ¬∞C F1 egg larva and pupa counts Each mated female was provided honey and one unparasitized fly host with only the anterior end of the fly pupa protruding from a foam plug This restricted the females ovipositing and thus localized egg laying to the anterior region of the fly pupae Twenty four hours later the fly hosts were removed for offspring counts and replaced in the foam plug with new unparasitized hosts To characterize the F1 hybrid incompatibility we reciprocally crossed N vitripennis strain and N longicornis strain IV7R3 b hereafter referred to as R3 to produce F1 hybrids Fig b Concurrently we set up control self crosses All mating pairs are denoted as male √ó female For all crosses females were hosted once with two hosts for h and then these hosts were placed in the incubator The Nasonia developed into pupae over days before pupa counts were performed Fig a √ó n = R3 √ó n = √ó R3 n = R3 √ó R3 n = For all counts some offspring were not counted until they had already emerged from the pupal stage to

UT n = To calculate the number of surviving first instar larvae the same procedure for egg counts was used except that the Nasonia embryos were allowed to develop undisturbed on the host for one and a half days before being counted Next we determined if the laboratory evolved asymmetric hybrid mortality is due to a cytonuclear interaction or maternal genetic effect by generating reciprocal F1 heterozygous females between N longicornis strains R3 and the compatible UT strain resulting in identical nuclear genomes but cytotypes derived from either R3 or UT Fig c For the heterozygous experimental crosses one half of the hosts for each cross were used for egg counts the day after hosting and the other half were incubated for another days and used for pupa counts The same procedure was used for the second hosting except the hosting group halves were switched The hostings for pupae in Fig a came after the hostings for pupae in Fig b Fig a UT √ó UT R3 n = √ó UT R3 n = √ó R3 UT n =

cytotype denoted IntUT R3 for nine generations each Fig d These introgression lines harbor ~ of the nuclear genotype of one N longicornis strain while maintaining the cytotype of the alternate strain

were used to compare statistical distributions of the number of daughters between each interspecific cross and corresponding intraspecific control cross for each experiment The statistical package JMP was used to perform Kolmogorov Smirnov tests to compare egg production female adult production male adult production and larva production between each interspecific cross and corresponding intraspecific control cross Testing for Wolbachia infection To confirm the uninfected Wolbachia status of the Nasonia strains used DNA was extracted using the Gentra PureGene DNA extraction kit QIAGEN¬Æ as well as a control infected strain N vitripennis Verification of infection status was performed using PCR with the primers ftsZuniF and fts2uniR as previously described Individual adult Nasonia n = UT n = R3 and n = n = Wolbachia positive Nasonia strain were tested and no Wolbachia was detected in the UT R3 or strains Cuticle prep methods To test embryonic and pre eclosing larval development eggs were collected from three R3 √ó R3 and three √ó R3 mated females Mated females laid eggs overnight at ¬∞C in individual egg laying chambers Eggs were collected to PBS agarose plates and incubated at ¬∞C for ~ h Unhatched eggs and empty cuticles were counted from each type of mating Unhatched eggs were transferred to a drop of lactic acid ethanol on a glass slide covered with x22mm cover glass and baked at ¬∞C overnight Some R3 √ó R3 eggs were collected and prepared after ~ h to catch them before hatching Cleared cuticles were observed under dark field optics Contrast and brightness were enhanced using Adobe Photoshop¬Æ Results All mating pairs are denoted as male √ó female Figure a shows that while there are no significant differences in hybrids produced in the interspecific cross R3 √ó and control cross √ó Kolmogorov Smirnov P = hereafter referred to as K S there is a significant and marked lack of hybrids observed in the reciprocal interspecific cross √ó R3 compared to control cross R3 √ó R3 K S P = Thus F1 hybrid reduction is contingent on having a father and R3 mother Due to the haplodiploid sex determination of Nasonia F1 haploid sons are not hybrids develop from unfertilized eggs and arise from the maternal genotype Accordingly in all of the inter and intraspecific crosses above and hereafter there are no significant differences in F1 male survival Fig a √ó R3 compared to R3 √ó R3 K S P = √ó R3 and T √ó R3 compared to R3 √ó R3 K S P = and P = respectfully For the two interspecific crosses using N longicornis R3 females and either N vitripennis or T Fig b males there were no hybrids produced Conversely the R3 √ó R3 control cross yielded normal numbers of offspring Fig b K S P < for both comparisons Since the underlying genetic factor for the hybrid reduction is presumably in both the N vitripennis and T strains it is likely that the incompatibility originated prior to their splitting Next we assessed whether the incompatibility in N longicornis is strain dependent by crossing males with females from a second N longicornis strain NAS NLUT A hereafter referred to as UT The UT and R3 strains were collected in Utah several decades ago Figure b shows that there was no reduction in F1 hybrids in the √ó UT cross compared to the control UT √ó UT cross K S P = Therefore the F1 hybrid reduction is specific to the extant strain R3 that was previously compatible with the same N vitripennis strain in the year Likewise when R3 was reestablished from larval diapause stocks from we again observed F1 hybrid reduction in the √ó R3 interspecific cross compared to that of the self R3 √ó R3 K S P = Thus we calibrate the spread of the N longicornis R3 incompatibility factor to an eight year time span between the years and For egg counts we observed no significant differences in fecundity between the interspecific cross √ó R3 and the control cross R3 √ó R3 Fig c K S P = Thus the decrease in F1 hybrids is due to postzygotic hybrid mortality We observed a significant reduction in the first instar larvae in the √ó R3 cross relative to the R3 √ó R3 control Fig c K S P < indicating the hybrid mortality is primarily embryonic the surviving larvae are haploid males Embryonic mortality is also evident by microscopy in which progeny from the R3 √ó R3 crosses failed to hatch after more than h while from the √ó R3 hybrid eggs failed to hatch Chi squared test P < The hatched embryos were haploid males and not hybrids Of the unhatched hybrid embryos many were tiny malformed and clearly inviable The cuticles of the inviable larvae had all three thoracic and ten abdominal segments but were highly compressed Fig Many also showed large openings on the dorsal side of the cuticle indicating a failure in dorsal closure Similar phenotypes have been observed in screens for embryonic lethal mutations in Nasonia and Drosophila These results imply that hybrid lethality likely affects a specific developmental process such as dorsal ventral patterning or extraembryonic membrane specification The N longicornis heterozygous genotypes are denoted UT R3 and R3 UT and represent paternal maternal origins We crossed these heterozygous females with N vitripennis males in two replicate experiments and observed significant hybrid reductions in crosses to both R3 UT or UT R3 females Fig a and b These results exclude the R3 cytotype causing hybrid mortality and are consistent with a maternal genetic effect incompatibility between the maternal R3 genotype and embryonic genotype irrespective of the N longicornis cytotype The N longicornis introgression lines used to test a maternal effect on hybrid incompatibility IntR3 UT and IntUT R3 exhibited an asymmetric F1 hybrid lethality when crossed to N vitripennis males Fig a Specifically hybrid mortality occurred in the incompatible cross with N longicornis females containing a majority R3 genome and a UT cytoplasm IntR3 UT In contrast N longicornis females with the UT genome and R3 cytoplasm produced slightly more offspring hybrids than the control self cross These and the aforementioned results validate the contingency of the hybrid mortality on a R3 nuclear genotype expressed maternally during oogenesis that in turn negatively interacts with N vitripennis nuclear genes in the embryo We found no hybrid lethality in the crosses with heterozygous or introgression lines between the two N longicornis strains indicating that the incompatibility arose specifically between R3 and N vitripennis It is important to note that although the control IntR3 UT cross in Fig a is not as fecund as the IntUT R3 line giving the appearance of a potential cytonuclear incompatibility between R3 genotype and UT cytotype there is no significant difference between egg and adult production for this line K S P = Therefore the incompatibility exhibited between species is not observed between strains withing the N longicornis species In Fig b we generated reciprocal F1 heterozygotes using the introgression lines R3 IntUT R3 and UT IntR3 UT these heterozygous genotypes contain different N longicornis cytotypes but the same N longicornis heterozygous nuclear genotypes If hybrid mortality with males is due to the proposed interaction between the R3 maternal genotype and N vitripennis embryonic genotype then N longicornis heterozygous mothers between R3 and UT should again yield partial mortality Indeed Fig b shows that there was approximately a reduction of daughters produced in both cross directions as expected Discussion The experiments presented here demonstrate for the first time that complete F1 hybrid lethality evolved in the laboratory between N vitripennis males and N longicornis females between to Assuming a two week generation time the incompatibility spread in less than generations in cultures typically maintained with less than thirty foundresses per generation The F1 hybrid mortality is in part due to a N longicornis R3 maternal genetic effect rather than the R3 cytotype This conclusion is principally based on experiments crossing N vitripennis males to reciprocal F1 heterozygous females between N longicornis strains R3 and the compatible UT strain that vary in cytotype If hybrid mortality was due to a cytonuclear interaction which is common in F2 hybrid males of Nasonia then hybrid mortality would have been unidirectional and contingent on parental females harboring the R3 cytotype Instead we observed hybrid mortality in both crosses Moreover there mortality appears to involve an interaction between an embryonic product of the N vitripennis genome and a maternal product of the R3 genome that is partially dominant or codominant with the maternal UT allele s since approximately half of the progeny of the heterozygous N longicornis UT R3 or R3 UT females succumb to lethality Given that the embryo lethality seems to be related to a fairly narrow set of developmental processes the tightly intertwined dorsoventral DV patterning and extraembryonic membrane specification processes a single locus developmental gene e g transcription factor or signal transduction pathway component would be a plausible genetic part of the hybrid incompatibility though this inference awaits future experimentation It is possible that a polymorphism within the species of N longicornis ultimately spread in the R3 line via correlated selection or drift to cause the F1 hybrid incompatibility as reviewed in While selection or drift may have fixed the polymorphism from standing genetic variation in the species the relatively few foundresses that established the R3 line and the subsequent inbreeding and bottlenecking of laboratory stocks likely reduced genetic variability and had an influence on the relatively sudden fixation within the laboratory Previous laboratory experiments on the evolution of reproductive isolation found that selection can drive fixation of traits and reproductive barriers in a short period of time as reviewed in Experimental evolution of Drosophila melanogaster on a diet of EDTA led to a high degree of variability in fitness fecundity in F1 hybrid crosses between the control and adapted strains Following these observations several generations of introgression switched the third chromosome of a control strain into the background of the EDTA adapted strain resulting in complete sterility of females on all diets as well as lethality of both sexes at high EDTA conditions While the sudden appearance of genetically based hybrid embryonic lethality in animal hybrids is very rare embryonic lethality in hybrid embryos occurs in other insects For instance several interspecific crosses within the Drosophila genus lead to embryonic lethality Similar to the incompatibility in Nasonia these defects are often sex specific and depend on the direction of the cross For example D melanogaster males √ó D simulans females produce lethality in female embryos D melanogaster females √ó D santomea males produce dead male embryos and D montana females √ó D texana males leads to complete female embryo lethality in early development Unlike Nasonia which lack sex chromosomes the sex specificity in Drosophila seems to arise from negative interactions between the X chromosome of one species and autosomal loci of the other In addition the Drosophila species pairs diverged million years ago while N longicornis and N vitripennis diverged approximately one million years ago Despite these major differences between insect systems some observations in Drosophila are relevant for the rapid appearance of hybrid embryonic lethality observed in Nasonia A survey of D simulans and D santomea populations found that there is natural variation affecting the strength or presence of the hybrid embryonic lethality when crossed to D melanogaster These and other cases in Arabidopsis and Tribolium suggest that alleles affecting hybrid incompatibilities are segregating within populations However it is unclear if within species genetic variation for hybrid incompatibilities spread recently or in the distant past The rate at which lineages evolve intrinsic postzygotic isolation has been benchmarked against the rate of prezygotic isolation evolution For example strains of allopatric Drosophila can have equal rates of divergence for pre and post zygotic reproductive isolation while birds develop postzygotic barriers much slower Extremely small population sizes and relatively short time frames have also never been linked to the evolution of hybrid mortality This lack of knowledge on the tempo of evolutionary genetic changes affecting hybrid incompatibilities suggests that the spread of alleles underlying genetically based hybrid mortality may be unusually prolonged in time and or restricted to large populations In contrast there is some evidence for the rapid evolution of bottleneck induced premating isolation Various speciation theories propose that evolution i e selection and or genetic drift in small demes can cause the spread of a particular set of traits and genetic make up which may lead to strong reproductive isolation For instance hybrid lethality between species could suddenly arise if selection or population bottlenecks fix segregating variation for hybrid lethality In the present work we observed the rapid evolution of a complete asymmetric F1 hybrid mortality within eight years of routine laboratory rearing These laboratory populations are maintained as small inbred populations where strong selection or genetic drift may have rapidly promoted the spread of allele s for complete F1 interspecific hybrid lethality Conclusions Here we have characterized the establishment of severe F1 hybrid mortality in observable time The asymmetric incompatibility spread in less than eight years under laboratory maintenance of small populations of a strain of N longicornis and is likely due to a negative interaction between a strain specific maternal genetic effect and a nuclear encoded product derived from N vitripennis in F1 hybrid embryos Hybrid mortality appears related to a disruption of early embryonic patterning where maternal effects and the zygotic genome first interact Abbreviations Acknowledgements We would like to thank Gina Qin for her help

5300,5300,Sep 4 A few years ago my horrible eye habits caught up with me My eyes were getting worse each year and with macular degeneration running rampant in my family thanks Dad some of my aunts were blind by the time they were my age That still did not stop me from sleeping in my contacts and wearing pairs that should have been tossed months ago as many times my parents warned me that it would catch up with me Eventually I tore the pupil of my left eye and though it healed quickly I ended up with a massive infection that transferred to my healthy eye I was told my days of wearing contacts were over and given topical prescription drops to keep me on the road My eyes had reached the point of tearing up with pain so frequently that being on the road was a very unsafe affair My dad quickly put me on lutein supplements after a year in glasses and keeping up with the lutein my optometrist was shocked to see that my prescription had not just gone down but my eyes were healthy enough to wear contacts again Since I was incredibly saddened by the previous prognosis I switched to expensive daily contacts and started accumulating as many funky frames on Etsy as I could find lenses are too expensive to waste a bunch of money on frames for me Wearing contacts every day is not an option for me my eyes are so close to the end that they need constant breaks to stay healthy and beautiful My year without contacts was filled with embarrassing moments and harsh realities It was during that year my friend s husband broke the news to me I would not be on their apocalypse team it was just too risky with my eyesight You just would not make it We will tie you up in the basement and come back for you If that does not drive a wedge between a friendship I do not know what does For now the length of my beauty routine is the biggest problem I have with glasses I can not tell you how many times I would realize that I only shaved percent of each leg or had to yell for my roommate because I lost my glasses while applying mascara and needed her eyes to find them Yes the woes of four eyed beauties are that serious you all Here are five beauty woes that four eyed beauties go through daily and some tips around them Face Routine I try to apply face masks on days that I already have my contacts on since I use daily wears I can not just pop in a pair and take them out I have ruined a pair of Warby Parker frames with a Turmeric ACV and lemon juice mask by dyeing the insides and I still have one pair of glasses that I am trying to get honey off of When I am desperate for a face mask and I am wearing glasses I apply my mask and literally just sit on the tub with my glasses in hand waiting the time until I can take them off If your eyesight is not too bad and you can see the path before you go about your routine the best you can before you wash your mask off and put your frames back on Need tips Check out our glasses makeup tutorial right here and subscribe to Bustle s YouTube for tons more Embed Shaving The best way for me to shave with glasses on is outside of the shower wait the only way to shave with glasses on is outside of the shower I can not tell you how many times I have forgotten that important tip while I am in the shower and my glasses are fogging sharp razor in hand Usually I refuse to admit that I need to see to shave and I just keep on going Of course when I put my glasses back on after the shower I am punished with bloody legs that have a section of hair I completely missed Sigh looks like I will be wearing leggings after all Applying Eye Makeup Yep my vision is so bad that doing it without glasses on is basically impossible unless I want to just sort of feel around until I find my eyeballs Woof this is one of my least favorite tasks to do with my glasses on mostly because I just can not seem to get close enough without the mascara brush or eyebrow pencil hitting the mirror Since my eyes are relatively small I feel I want to apply mascara while wearing my glasses even more At minimum I am applying mascara and drawing on my eyebrows The eyebrows usually need a second opinion but as long as I keep some witch hazel and Q tips handy I can do a clean up of any botched make up job with my glasses on Jewelry I once had a friend who coined herself a fashionista tell me that I should not wear earrings with glasses That would have been a huge bummer because for some reason all of my piercings close if they are not used no matter how long I have had them Honestly there s no need to ditch your jewelry while wearing funky frames the Frisky s site suggests that long dangly earrings actually diverts attention from the center of your face and pulls your look together To be fair they are talking rimless or wire framed glasses let us be real though are not most of us just getting funkier with our frames each year I say go for your fave pieces regardless of size because that fashion rule is one I just cannot follow If earrings are not your thing you can not go wrong with a long necklace Hats I actually do have one fashion rule I follow When I wear a hat I do not wear my biggest boldest pair of glasses This is more of a personal rule because when I wear a hat my hair is completely hidden and if I hide my small face Then I look like I am hiding from everyone However if I am wearing a small boaters hat that sits off my face and my smaller pair of glasses I am all about that life The right hat and the right frames can nail this look Bonus Tip This is the time to avoid earrings bigger than a stud to avoid distracting accessories from your natural beauty Image TheKarenD Suzette Flickr Giphy Kristin Collins Jackson

At prose they create custom hair products specially made - just. for. you. They ask a series of brief (but very important) questions to be able to properly understand you and your hair needs (and wants). Their consultation is so thorough that they even consider your zip code to better understand humidity/wind/temp and pollution levels. (That‚Äôs pretty cool!) After you finish your consultation you‚Äôre given the option to submit photos of your locks so that a trained professional can reference those photos and compare them with your answers to their earlier questions to make sure you answered properly.

2999,2999,But if the kohen looks at it and there is no white hair in the baheres and it is not lower than the skin and it is dim the kohen shall quarantine him for seven days Vayikra IT CONTINUES TO be ironic how the parshios have something to say about the current situation perhaps this one more than others These parshios are the only ones that discuss the halachos that lead to biddud isolation It is the technical word used for quarantine here in Israel and the one the Torah uses for the person who gets tzara as physical leprosy for spiritual reasons As Rashi later explains isolation of the metzora was measure for measure For distancing others from one another through loshon hara derogatory speech the metzora was socially distanced from others by going into isolation It was supposed to make them personally feel the impact of their words and cause them to do teshuva Of course such laws would not work today unless the Bais Din also denied the metzora all access to social media Today you can go into your own closest and still attack others via the social media network as long as you have an Internet connection or good phone reception To REALLY be in biddud today a person would have to leave behind all of that or at least greatly limit it to official business alone There s another aspect of biddud as well at least for the Torah Jew that not too many are considering Personally I missed it until now focusing only on my inability to be part of a minyan and not so much on the place in which the minyan was occurring in a SHUL Perhaps that is one of the reasons why we have lost access to it The Talmud states that since the destruction of the Temple the shul has become somewhat of a minuscule replacement for it There is no ACTUAL replacement for the Temple but we need something in the meantime to keep us connected to the idea of one That has been the Beis Knesses the synagogue the shul so that when we finally DO get our Temple back it should be quickly in our time we ll still be familiar with the idea of a place that G D inhabits Of course most shul going people are aware of the necessary decorum of a such a holy place though they may forget themselves from time to time It s difficult enough to hold G D in your mind while praying Holding Him there even during non prayer times is even MORE difficult for many Besides is G D REALLY there Isn t the whole idea just a zecher something we do to remember what it once was like Everyone knows we re living in a time of hester panim The Shechinah long ago withdrew to higher planes of existence What aspect of G D s Presence is LEFT to give shuls such an elevated status that we should treat them like the miniature temples they re meant to be We could get Kabbalistic at this point and blow away the whole concept of space and time but that would get intellectually messy Besides the point can be made in simpler terms and that s good enough for this discussion There is something in Kabbalah called a roshem Basically the word means impression as in the person made a good impression on others Kabbalah teaches that when it comes to things of holiness these always leave some kind of holy impression wherever they go So yes if you doven mincha at the bus station or at an airport even without a minyan the kedushah holiness you created while there remains after you have left Anyone who walks through it will get a burst of holiness the amount depending upon how much was created in the first place This is a fascinating concept with a lot of corollaries But the main point is that once there is kedushah in a particular place it can never really leave that place completely even if its source has Therefore even if G D has withdrawn from the lower levels of Creation His roshem remains behind ALWAYS where He was But there is more and the Talmud alludes to this When it says that a shul is a Mikdash Miat a miniature Temple it is not speaking figuratively only It is saying that every time a shul opens up anywhere in the world for the right reasons it is endowed with some of that roshem It is imbued with some Temple holiness which is why it is SO important to maintain the sanctity of the place It is also why the Talmud says that in the Messianic Era the shuls will fly to Eretz Yisroel from all over the world It is their Temple sanctity that makes them relevant to Eretz Yisroel but ONLY if it was a place that the Shechinah could inhabit If people did not conduct themselves in the shul as necessary to host the Shechinah then it will never have received its holiness or connection to the Messianic Era I never really thought much about any of this until now At first I thought that it was the minyan itself that I missed which I do But that wasn t what carried me If anything it often frustrated me going faster than I wanted to go Rather it is the Shechinah that carries each of us who come to its place of residence to pray or for any other holy activity Walk through the doors of an official shul even if in someone s basement and you are welcomed by the Shechinah itself Brochos b Then as you pray it prays with you strengthening you allowing you to draw on it as a source of spiritual energy if you make the effort to put yourself into your tefillah Perhaps this is a major part of the biddud of the Metzora Would you speak loshon hara if you knew G D was listening in Of course not But then again isn t He ALWAYS listening in Of course He is Then how did you speak loshon hara Because you forgot that He was there alongside you the entire time since His glory fills the entire world at ALL times So the Torah says since the loshon hara speaker acted alone he has to live alone And as most of us have learned over the last few weeks it s when you are most alone that you most feel the Presence of G D There s nothing else TO feel because there is nothing else to distract us away from the Presence of G D There is more Tzara as was an affliction of the skin because that is what changed as a result of the loshon hara of the snake back in the Garden of Eden Adam s skin went from spiritual light to physical skin and the world became more material as a result He had acted as if G D wasn t there and his change of skin was the result The speaker of loshon hara acts as if G D isn t there and gets a skin affliction as their consequence It is a message to take to heart at this time of biddud without even getting into what might be the measure for measure of this current pandemic which is questionable But we do know one consequence solitary confinement and social distancing It may not only be about the wronging of other people as much as people acting as if G D doesn t exist or doesn t care about what they do He does And He s EVERYWHERE at ALL times We re going to find this out sooner or later If sooner then things just might get better If later then expect things to I am now using Twitter these days to share my idea and opinions for those who are interested

8135,8135,Ordered the light blonde and Medium blonde. Neither were blending in with my hair color. More of a deal breaker was: I couldn't get the twists to hold in place. So if you trying to add volume to an already thin head of hair; its ironic that you need more hair to hold the twists in place. If I had a full head of thick hair that would hold the twists in place; I wouldn't need the hairpiece in the first place. LOL

4608,4608,Stepping outside the medical fortress Part Once upon a time men built a medical fortress to protect humans from dangers Eventually some of the protected began to realize the new problem they were inside the fortress That s where a great deal of the trouble was The casual observer knows bits and pieces of modern medicine s history the famous Flexner Report of sponsored by the Carnegie Foundation the switch from a patchwork quilt of snake oils nostrums simple natural practices and sophisticated therapies to Rockefeller pharmaceutical medicine the advancing technology of surgery At first Rocky Med was a new entry on the scene muscling in striving to become the leading competitor in a crowded field But soon enough what was lurking in the shadows emerged the ambition for monopoly The rigging of an exclusive Pharma Standard against which lesser healing approaches would have to be measured Resulting from an alliance between pharmaceutical medicine and government those older approaches would go down to defeat or at best suffer classification as second class citizens What an idea government sanctioned and protected medicine Where in the Constitution was a provision made for such an audacious and tyrannical concept Flash forward to these times There are so many illustrations of the power of Pharma and medical care you can close your eyes and point in any direction and they ll be there On television the veteran viewer is pounded by drug commercials around the clock These ads conspire to claim hundreds and hundreds of conditions and diseases are loose in the world and require immediate diagnosis and treatment The world IS medical The breaks between commercials brim with fact and fiction story telling about doctors hospitals and prominent people who suddenly faced medical crises and achieved rescue through treatment Absurdly networks employ reporters who actually specialize in digging up these human interest tragedy to triumph mini biographies Step by step leap by bound the whole culture has become saturated with The Medical For many people now the thought of a time when humans managed to survive beyond adolescence without doctors issuing edicts and writing prescriptions every few months I mean I guess I can imagine it the way I can imagine the old days when people didn t have refrigerators Mothers watching their children for early signs of a sniffle resemble momma cheetahs crouched on promontories scanning the horizon for predators with a yen for their cubs THE NATURAL AND INEVITABLE OUTGROWTH OF ALL THIS CULTURE IS EPIDEMICS If they didn t exist they would have to be invented Let me qualify that Recent history reveals they don t exist and the fake IMPRESSION of them HAS been invented And why stop with advertising an epidemic Call it a pandemic Inventing the idea of a pandemic is now as easy as selling a new Honda The benefits to the monopolists are obvious Profits from the sale of drugs and vaccines De facto if not legal mandates to take the drugs and vaccines Long term cashing in on conditioning populations to accept medical orders of any kind thus enrolling humans in utero to grave care as they trudge along bleak highways of diagnoses and treatments So people tell me what we re shooting for now Is it forty sixty a hundred diagnoses per life per human Our marketing departments are restructuring and they want to know Pandemics with mass lockdowns are the next frontier and we re there The lockdowns plus television FOCUS people on the inner game of Medical THINK SICK It s a major winner It would be on the order of the Cadillac Company having the ability to induce people to contemplate their cars day and night Sitting alone in rooms This is what the alliance between modern medicine and government has achieved And as I say the invention of fake pandemics is entirely expected Part An unscrupulous pharmaceutical CEO who shoots on the country club golf course he and his CDC caddy are thrashing through the woods trying to find his lost ball the CEO pulls a new ball out of his pocket looks around furtively and places it in a nice little patch of short grass and says FOUND IT The obsessive caddy whispers to his boss Sir just want to make sure you know when people take enough drugs and vaccines they re debilitated They follow orders more dutifully They re easier to rule The CEO gives the caddy a look that says it all Of course I know I m the boss I m in the greatest business in the world It s self perpetuating Now hand me my six iron Spread out along the fairways towers support giant neon signs flashing ZOLOFT PAXIL VICODIN ZOCOR LISINOPRIL LEVOTHYROXIN METFORMIN DTaP TWINRIX HAVRIX GARDASIL Beyond the fences of the golf course we can see stone and brick walls rising and turrets and gatehouses and keeps The golf course is inside the fortress Just behind the th green sits a hospital Red lights blazing ambulances are pulling up Workers are unloading people on stretchers Outside the fortress armed guards are patrolling the perimeter One guard with gray hair and a rough weathered face turns to his buddy and says You know the boss in there the fat guy who shoots a hundred who owns the place A few months ago I met him at a charity event I introduced him to my son Can you believe it My son met the big honcho I told him Jimmy is getting good grades in high school and the next day Jimmy has a job cleaning the signs on the fairway Now it looks like he s going to get a scholarship to college I mean I cried I never asked the boss for a dime There are some good people around here You just have to be patient Deep in the recesses of the lavishly appointed clubhouse the CEO is addressing a gaggle of his senior aides in a quiet room We re leaking people Or someone is leaking somewhere Details about the operation are finding their way into articles and videos I hold you responsible We must have a tight seal on this thing I go back to basics PANDEMICS ARE MARKETING TOOLS Nothing more nothing less If we know that we approach our business with a keen eye A hundred years of building a wall to wall medical culture are NOT going to go down the drain because somebody with a conscience decides to blow the whistle The virus is real because we say it s real People are dying for the reasons WE announce Our current pandemic label COVID is legitimate because we made it up and what we invent is automatically true Nothing else is Do you get it We control the story Without us there is no story Now to bury the leaks our tactic must be MORE STORY Our brand Spread it like peanut butter and jelly and clouds and rain and snow and demons on the loose and Armageddon and cyanide and I want the great unwashed snitching on each other for a cough like East Germany and I want Biblical plagues falling from the sky and I want case numbers jacked up into the hundreds of millions and I want those idiots at Google and Facebook and Twitter to black out every single goddamn counter to our position by tomorrow and I want the biggest celebrities in the world on every channel from here to the moon saying we re all in this together and we ll get through it and I want Obama and Bush and Hillary and Romney and the Pope to say stay at home and I want China to report a wave of new cases and I want Italy to say Michelangelo s David is infected and I want the CDC and WHO to say the danger of reinfection is death and I want hundreds more high production made on sound stage videos of wild chaotic overflowing ICUs distributed to the press and I want two thousand dollar pacifying checks sent out to every American immediately and I want a slam bang in your face and down you go VACCINE to hit the market by next week and I want a slew of military vessels at sea to declare quarantines and I want He stopped talking There was silence in the room Finally one aide asked Where will you be Rex if we need to talk to you up close and personal Out on the golf course looking for a lost ball Those things cost six dollars apiece Laughter applause Rex Rex the aide says you send kids to college on scholarships and you re worried about the price of a golf ball Some of those kids become doctors Pharmaceutical agents Golf balls don t do anything for me They sure don t Have you broken a hundred yet More laughter Rex nods Good point But playing lousy golf makes me angry I channel that anger into my work With genetic implants if I don t turn into a gargoyle I hope to live long enough to see the day when every damn human on Earth is hooked on our drugs For that to come true we re going to need more pandemics Use this link to order Jon s Matrix Collections Jon Rappoport

Could be hormones. Could be the iron loss from the bleeding. I usually hand my wife an iron pill supplement to counter the anemia. Congrats at the test result you wanted!

7796,7796,Background Hydroxy methylglutaryl coenzyme A HMG CoA lyase deficiency is a rare inborn error of metabolism characterized by recurrent metabolic crises caused by fasting intercurrent illness and excessive physical exercise Non ketotic hypoglycemia is normally the cause of primary symptoms but without an immediate treatment the illness can evolve into a worsening metabolic state resembling the Reye s syndrome that may cause the patient s death We report a case with some clinical and therapeutic features not previously described Case presentation Patient with HMG CoA lyase deficiency whom after diagnosis at years of age was re admitted years later after severe metabolic decompensation following consumption of alcohol Despite a quick correction of hypoglycemia within the following few hours the patient fell into a coma Suspecting intracranial hypertension ICH the patient required mechanical ventilation Although liver cytolysis was minimal hyperamoniemia reached Œºmol L returning to normal a few hours after administering sodium phenylacetate and sodium benzoate whose use has not been reported in these patients Brain edema was evidenced in the computed tomography and by the magnetic resonance imaging that determined that the edema was cytotoxic as quantified with the restriction of diffusion in the apparent diffusion coefficient map During the recovery of the ICH we belatedly detected vasospasm moderate severe that was treated with nimodipine Currently the patient maintains clinical normality Conclusions The alcohol consumption must be avoided in patients with HMG CoA lyase deficiency In our patient hyperamoniemia was effectively treated with sodium phenylacetate and sodium benzoate Magnetic resonance imaging showed and quantified the cytotoxic brain edema Belatedly a cerebral vasospasm was an additional mechanism of cerebral injury None of these observations has been previously reported Background Hydroxy methylglutaryl coenzyme A HMG CoA lyase deficiency is a recessive autosomal hereditary disease described for the first time by Faull et al This mitochondrial enzyme catalyzes the cleavage of HMG CoA to form acetyl CoA and acetoacetate which is the common final step of ketogenesis and leucine degradation The illness is characterized by recurrent metabolic crises which generally start in the early neonatal period or in the first year of life These crises are caused by fasting intercurrent illness and excessive physical exercise The non ketotic hypoglycemia is normally the cause of primary symtoms But the illness can evolve into a worsening metabolic state resembling the Reye s syndrome Such crises can cause death in of cases and serious long term health predicaments such as psychomotor retardation epilepsy hepatic steatosis pancreatitis or dilated cardiomyopathy Patients with HMG CoA lyase deficiency show a diagnostic urinary organic acids pattern Confirmation diagnosis requires determining the enzyme activity or a genetic study The altered gene is the HMGCL located on chromosome p36 1 and mutations have been identified The most common in Mediterranean countries and the second most common in the world is the E37X We report a new case of HMG CoA lyase deficiency whom after the diagnosis at years of age was once again re admitted years later after severe metabolic decompensation following consumption of alcohol Case presentation Following h of food rejection and vomiting due to a cold our years old Spanish child was admitted into the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit PICU with clinical symptoms of hypoactivity hypotonia vomiting and transient loss of consciousness The patient had no previous illness of interest The patient s parents were Moroccan consanguineous and without any illness of note Patient examination on admission showed a Glasgow Coma Scale GCS of tiredness hypotonia and mild hepatomegaly Vital signs were all normal Blood analysis highlighted severe hypoglycemia mg dL without ketosis moderate metabolic acidosis and hyperlactatemia mmol L The ammonium level was slightly elevated Œºmol L Following the intravenous administration of glucose there was an immediate and sustained stabilization of blood glucose The following h also saw the normalization of metabolic acidosis hyperlactatemia and consciousness An electroencephalogram EEG showed no significant pathological alterations and the magnetic resonance imaging MRI indicated small hyperintensity in FLAIR and T2 sequences in the frontal subcortical white matter suggestive of demyelination areas The metabolic study showed increased urinary metabolites of leucine suspecting HMG CoA lyase deficiency The diagnostic confirmation was done via a genetic study the patient was homozygous for the E37X mutation The patient received treatment with L carnitine and outpatient control until years of age when he cut short his attendance At years of age he returned to our Pediatric Emergency Department due to a loss of consciousness following vomiting brought on by alcohol consumption a few hours before vodkas with coke The family made no reference to previous illnesses or admissions excepting some infant resolved episodes of hypoglycemia On examination the patient was unconscious with ocular revulsion generalized tremors and hypertonia suggestive of generalized tonic seizure All other vital signs were as normal A blood analysis highlighted severe hypoglycemia mg dL without ketosis metabolic acidosis pH pC02 mmHg HC03‚àí mEq L base excess ‚àí mEq L and hyperlactatemia mmol L The biochemical blood

1354,1354,By Bloomberg September Jill Soltau is making a long shot bid at J C Penney Co to do what her predecessors could not uncover what customers really want from the ailing department store chain J C Penney Store | Source Shutterstock By Bloomberg September NEW YORK United States Jill Soltau is making a long shot bid at J C Penney Co to do what her predecessors could not uncover what customers really want from the ailing department store chain Soltau joined the company last October with the stock in a free fall that has yet to reverse During her second day on the job as the company s first female chief executive she commissioned a survey that came back with some telling findings Customers are tied to their digital devices they care about fashion and want to forge an emotional connection with the places they shop J C Penney had work to do in every category Soltau said in her first sit down interview since she started the job Within the first six months of her tenure she identified of the department store locations for closure and exited the major appliance business which had been reintroduced by prior CEO Marvin Ellison in She also moved most furniture sales to online only It has not been a great shopping experience I think largely because the company had lost its sight on doing what s right for the customer Soltau said in an interview in Fort Worth Texas Customers have been confused and not sure who we are who we are trying to be she said Other changes she s put in place since then may not seem as radical ritzier fitting rooms a lot less merchandise and more experiences like in store workshops on makeup application and home cooking but the results are promising she says A company test of its new dressing room model inside two stores resulted in customers with a more than percent bigger shopping basket Still with foot traffic falling and four straight quarterly declines in same store sales Soltau acknowledges she has a lot of work ahead The question is how much longer investors are willing to wait Shares are down percent since the start of the year despite a wider bull market that s driven the S P up percent If it seems Soltau is moving deliberately and maybe a bit slower than Wall Street might like there s a good reason In the company burned a lot of customer goodwill when it made the critical error of scrapping coupons thinking buyers would rather have low prices all the time than feel the buzz of snagging a limited time deal Yet by doing so J C Penney misjudged its core audience and it has taken time to win them back The CEO s office has also been a revolving door with four leaders in less than eight years Sometimes there s a lot to undo says Soltau who previously ran the arts and craft retailer Jo Ann Stores LLC This company has made a lot of promises that it has not fulfilled she says We have got to earn the trust back of our customers of our vendors of our investors and the only way to do that is share once we have results Shares dipped in Tuesday trading falling as much as percent to a one week low S P Global Ratings downgraded the retailer last month citing growing risk that it will pursue a debt restructuring in the next months It has close to billion of total debt including bonds revolving loans and a term loan according to data compiled by Bloomberg The New York Stock Exchange told the company this summer that it was at risk for delisting if it could not get its share price higher It s been hovering much of this year in penny stock status Compounding the year old chain s internal woes are the broader challenges faced by U S department stores Once the country s shopping anchors they continue to stumble even as the retail sector overall remains relatively strong Earlier this month Moody s Investors Service cut its operating income forecast for department stores to a percent decline from an earlier outlook for a percent drop Soltau says the in store experience keeps department stores relevant in an increasingly e commerce world And she pointed to the new fitting rooms as one example In a corner of the Alliance Town Center store in Fort Worth the space is brightly lit with decorative wallpaper and larger mirrors that contrast with the dark dingy messy rooms of yore Tables hold jewellery handbags and other suggested accessories that customers could buy and more frequently do it turns out when they are right there in front of them Perfume lipstick and free tote bags that say It s Not What You Wear It s How You Own It are part of the redesign The space is staffed with a full time stylist Shoppers can capture the moment with Polaroid cameras available for use The section is only for women currently though men s department renovations are planned The fitting rooms and workshops show that Soltau is focused on shoring up J C Penney s core business of being an apparel and accessories retailer says Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Poonam Goyal Can this be scaled Goyal asked Everything that she s put out so far is good but I still can not justify them having plus stores Soltau says the new styling sections address both foot traffic and sales troubles at the chain known colloquially as Penney s And she says J C Penney will remain in malls despite concerns those venues are a dying breed Some percent of transactions at the retailer are in store she says even if percent of our customers start their path to purchase online The chief executive says she does not have plans at the moment to shutter any more of the chain s locations The tests of fitting rooms workshops pop up shops and larger lounge areas could change the way that people think about malls the way that people think about Penney s she says The way I look at it is we have so many problems to fix and so many new efforts that we are developing for our customer Other chains are also revamping their layouts to broaden experiential shopping Macy s carved out space in dozens of stores to create a shop in shop that changes themes every few months Kohl s rolled out its Amazon com Inc partnership nationally and Nordstrom Inc is offering more tailoring and ramping up restaurant options at its New York flagship that opens next month Soltau has also sharpened her focus on the chain s well known and oft lamented oversupply of products The company cut inventory by percent last quarter and reduced markdowns which had been hurting sales The Fort Worth store continues to offer many items at percent and percent off a sign it s still clearing excess inventory That will continue to be a focus along with reducing options to keep the stores from feeling too crowded Analyst Goyal says if Soltau s strategies had been put in place in they would likely have been more successful than what her predecessors did bringing other distractions to make up for the bleeding core Shoppers will start to see more of her plan come into fruition as the critical holiday season approaches Soltau promises that the retailer will show up this holiday in a way our customer has not seen in a long time It will not be perfect yet she says We have a long way to go but our customer will feel the change By Jordyn Holman Editors Anne Riley Moffat Lisa Wolfson

1018,1018,"The whole left-right spatial theory of politics seems to have outlived it's usefulness. ‚Äã I was struck watching Peterson's debate at how many Leftists are not just flirting with violence, but actually looking forward to it. Real strength is the ability to endure violence, not inflict it. People like Solomon Northup (12 Years a Slave) and Solzhenitsyn were able to reveal the inhumanity of institutions by retaining their humanity, despite the oppression. ‚Äã So let's look at at an actual definition \[merriam-webster\]: > Definition of fascism > > **1** *often capitalized* **:** a political philosophy, movement, or regime (such as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that **stands for a centralized** [**autocratic**]( ) **government headed by a** [**dictatorial**]( ) **leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition** ‚Äã It's pretty clear to me that there are fascists on the right invoking [nationalism]( ?v=9IsT4-mhado) to suppress the individual and promoting racism through poorly researched science. But there are also fascists on the left, asking for oppressive economic restrictions, a government that rules by tanks to enforce them, and the extermination of anyone who disagrees. Each side will happily call out the other to distract from the fact that their own ideology is just as violent and inhumane. They are not growing in opposition to each other, they are strengthening each other. Both would rather have us talking about who we should be violent toward than questioning the necessity of violence in the first place. ‚Äã I'm not saying that anyone who isn't a centrist is a fascist, I'm saying that **anyone who endorses the use of violence to promote their ideology is a fascist**, and we shouldn't be afraid to call it out when we see it."

6752,6752,plural marauders Definition of marauder one who roams from place to place making attacks and raids in search of plunder one that marauds I did not sign up for this shit I began indifferent to the pissed off look that was spreading across Wildman s face You think I fucking care if your men pull a train on her I snarled The girl s head moved and I knew that she was looking at me through the curtain of her hair You bring a dirty little bitch in here and expect me to fuck her I have standards I knew that I was pushing him but a man like Wildman would expect some push back I d learned early on that he liked putting his brothers in their place he liked the power it gave him I d tested him more than once still trying to figure out how far I could go before it was too far With him you never knew He was unpredictable and he never reacted to the same type of situation in the same way That s what made him dangerous Just as I d expected Wildman threw back his head and roared with the mad kind of laughter one might hear in an asylum but there was little humor in his eyes when he put them back on me I felt the woman next to me stir but I ignored her knowing that only a fool would take their eyes off Wildman I d seen him attack a man when he d least expected it So give her a shower before you fuck her I do not give a shit But until you bloody that little virgin pussy your place in the Red Devils stays on the table He pulled the door shut on his way out Sick fuck I could not wait for my club to end him If Stone did not do it I would and with fucking pleasure Baby I felt a hand moving under the sheet and the next thing I knew the club whore that had been sleeping in the bed was groping my dick and balls She was apparently oblivious to what had just occurred still hung over I could smell the stench of her sour breath I pulled the covers back took her hand and threw it back at her then left the bed Get the fuck out The girl that Wildman had brought in had not moved from her spot I went to her and pushed back the curtain of flaxen hair that covered her face She kept her eyes lowered as I took in her delicate features noting the bruises and the blood at the corner of her lip Even through the abuse I could see how stunningly beautiful she was all over but it was her full Angelina Jolie lips that caused my dick to take notice Look at me I demanded softly keeping my hands on either side of her face where I held her hair When she ignored me I gave her a little shake Finally she raised her gaze to mine and a pair of the brightest bluest eyes I d ever seen looked into mine How old are you There was no way that she was legal She swallowed before answering Twenty one Her voice was so small that I had a hard time hearing her There was no fucking way I narrowed my eyes searching for the truth And you are still a virgin I had a hard time believing that a woman who looked like her had not been touched She nodded and I gave her a little shake I want the words when I ask you a question Y yes she responded her bottom lip trembling Who the hell are you I scowled She wet her lips before replying softly Ginger Pruitt I snorted I could care less about last names How did you come to be here I didn t know what the fuck I was doing when I should have just fucked her and got on with the program My job had been to infiltrate the Red Devils which I d done Now I had to go through Wildman s sick demands to stay in the club or weeks of shit work would all be for nothing Stone would not be happy if I screwed this up now Hell more than just Dark Menace wanted the Red Devils gone Answer me I knew that I should not care but my gut told me that she wasn t a hang around or any other kind of MC groupie looking to take a walk on the wild side The fact that she d been abused led me to believe that she d been taken against her will I was walking home from work when two men in a van forced me to get inside I I fought them My lips quirked at that and then she surprised me by adding with sudden grit I am going to fight you too I laughed gruffly and turned toward the bed only to see that the whore had fallen back to sleep I stared down at her for a minute taking in her snarly blonde hair and black roots and the smear of makeup surrounding her eyes and lips She wasn t as attractive this morning as she d been the night before after I d downed a bottle of whiskey In fact she was drooling Her ass was nicer than her tits I never had liked the things women did to them when they added too much of that silicone shit I reached for my jeans and gave the snoring woman a hard slap on the ass She jumped awake bitching and scowling her hand flying back to the abused area Get out What the fuck She left the bed mumbling You said you were going to do me this morning I snorted slipping into my pants Do her nasty snatch I d seen her fucking several brothers before she d come with me to my room I d gotten what I d wanted Why would I do you when I can have this fresh little virgin I zipped up my pants but left the snap undone The whore who d been in the process of searching for the only piece of clothing she d been wearing the night before a thong stopped to look up Her gaze ran over Ginger with disdain She half laughed half snorted I was her once Wildman s initiation right She giggled like a mad woman finally locating her thong He makes all his men do it She walked around the bed and stopped in front of Ginger A word of advice honey when it s over you will be given a choice become a club whore or go home She snorted before continuing It s a stupid choice They want you to say that you want to go home so they have a reason to pull a train on you and then kill you They could do that anyway I thought She left my room stark naked Ginger s gaze came back to me and I could see the horror in her eyes I had no doubt that what the whore had said was true What is a train Her innocence was starting to piss me off She should not be there She should not have put herself in a situation where she could be snatched up off the street Christ she wasn t a kid She should have been protecting herself better As far as I was concerned it was her fault that she was in this mess A train is where all the men in the club line up and take turns fucking you With each word her eyes grew bigger All of them I could see her mind working as if she was trying to figure out how many men that might be She would not survive it There were too many of them and they were ruthless cruel bastards She d be ripped apart and would probably die on the table Jesus this whole fucking mess was starting to get to me I was in a one percent MC and we did shit for the club in order to survive and to take care of our families We did not involve innocents or civilians just for the thrill of it This whole club and everyone in it needed to die When I saw tears fill her blue eyes I lost patience For fuck s sake do not start crying It will not solve anything I knew I was being insensitive but if she was going to survive this she needed to suck it up and I did not know how she was going to do that if I coddled her It was a fact that anger had a way of turning weakness into strength frustration into determination and fear into perseverance I knew what I had to do and by the time I was done with little miss innocent Ginger she was going to hate me enough to survive My gaze darted to the back door of the bar Could I make it The urge to flee was surging through my body but I was still frozen in place So many thoughts flashed through my mind as I tried to come up with a rational excuse for why Rebel was there leaving me with a sick feeling in my belly I could not fight him and win I knew I could not yet when he finally took that last step into the light and I saw the gleam in his eyes I knew that I would have to try I would not go back He d have to kill me first Our eyes locked I could not read anything from his expression As hopelessness overwhelmed me I made a mad dash for the door He caught me as I d known he would I was able to let out a scream before he slapped a hand over my mouth and then he was dragging me back into the shadows with him I struggled against him with the fear of an animal that was trapped with nowhere to go Ssshhh he shushed me in my ear the powerful arms surrounding me like an inescapable vice I am not going to hurt you angel I am not going back with you I hated the fear in my voice I hated giving him that With his powerful arms locked around me he easily kept me subdued He grunted when one of my elbows jabbed him in the ribs I have been looking for you for four years Oh God I closed my eyes trembling at the soft words he d uttered into my ear the warmth and solidness of his hard body seeping into me Infuriatingly I was reminded of the way he d made me feel all those years ago and how quickly he d turned an innocent girl into a wild and wanton whore He d had that powerful effect on me No other man ever had I d been helpless against his experience and he d known exactly how to play my body I mean it Rebel I d never thought that I would see him again and his name sounded strange on my lips You will have to kill me before I let you drag me back to the Red Devils I dug my nails into his arms hoping that he would release me but all he did was grunt and tighten his arms around me until I could barely breathe When I threw my head back he snarled spun me around and grabbed me by the hair walking me backwards to the side of the building where he crushed me with his much larger body Did you forget that I was the one who got you out of there I did not come here to take you back he rasped pinning me easily Now stop I remembered that but why was he here then His sudden appearance rendered me unable to think clearly I do not believe you I whispered my panic growing as everything I d been forced to go through at the Red Devils clubhouse came back to me full force You are one of them I was never one of them he said roughly Why do you think I helped you escape Hehadhelped me escape He d snuck me out of the Red Devils clubhouse and taken me to his place telling me to wait for his return I would have followed his instructions if some of the Red Devils had not shown up I d been forced to sneak out of a back window and run I d gone straight to the bus station But that was then and this was now and I was convinced that he was here to take me back Then why have you come for me if not to bring me back to Wildman There is no more Wildman or the Red Devils he gritted out trapping my legs between his when I made an attempt to raise my knee Wildman s dead and so is his club Dead I slowly ceased my struggles as I took that in Was this a trick or had the rumors that I d heard actually been true Had I been running from them all this time for nothing I wanted to believe Rebel I wanted to believe that I did not need to look over my shoulder anymore that I did not need to keep running How why I could not seem to form a coherent sentence He laughed at my expense but I was more concerned about why he was there Suddenly it occurred to me that he was probably looking for the money I d stolen I d found it as I d snooped around his apartment and had left it alone at first until the Red Devils had shown up Then I d needed it to get away You are here for the money I borrowed I let myself relax against him It could not be for anything else He snorted Yeah borrowed There was a slight pause before he murmured Among other things I wondered what those other things could be before I shifted my thoughts back to the money that I owed Rebel The money that I d been squirreling away since I d made my escape was only about half of the four thousand that I d taken After a few minutes of silence I began to notice things about him that seemed way too intimate in the moment the feel of his warm whiskey scented breath against my face the scent of leather and smoke that clung to his large and threatening body mixed with something else something that was all Rebel his personal essence and my personal drug Four years had not done anything to diminish his appeal to me I closed my eyes thankful that he could not see me clearly I had to get a grip and ignore how easily he had made me want him again All those years ago when he d been forced to take my virginity it had been too easy for Rebel I d barely put up a resistance when he d seduced me with his experience and the unspoken promise that he would not hurt me I d lost myself to him the instant that he d put his rough hands on me I do not have all of your money I finally said deciding to be honest with him We can talk about that later Is this where you work Yes What time do you get off As soon as I am done cleaning up Do you have a way home I shook my head No Good I will wait for you here and take you home He released a tired breath I need a place to crash and get some sleep I stiffened realizing that he intended to go home with me What about my boyfriend I did not have a boyfriend but I did not want Rebel to think that he could just come into my life and take over I wasn t ready to trust him You do not have a boyfriend he said surprising me If you did he d be here to pick you up I could detect the mild amusement in his tone Now go inside and finish up so we can get the hell out of here I resisted his attempt to pull me away from the wall tugging back You can not just show up after four years and start ordering me around We are nothing to each other I may have been a frightened virgin when we d met but the last few years had taught me how to stand up and fight for myself I am not afraid of you Rebel His gruff laugh sent chills down my spine I can see that And I do not want anything to do with you That was a lie but a necessary one How many times had I found myself yearning to see him To be with him again Are you forgetting about the money you took God I had I only have half right now I d always known that there was a possibility that he would come after me for the money but as more time had gone by I d convinced myself that he was either dead or he just did not care I was relieved that he was still alive but it meant that he was going to take every penny that I d managed to put away for an emergency That s too bad I want it all Ginger met Rebel due to circumstances beyond her control Kidnapped by a nefarious MC and forced to obey their commands she ends up in Rebel s care But she doesn t know Rebel is a member of another MC and has infiltrated the evil group to take them down She ends up in the best possible situation even though she is unaware of it at the time And his expert assault on her senses creates an addiction that cannot be fulfilled by any other She isn t aware of how deep her feelings run until Rebel makes an attempt to save her and she unexpectedly has to run for her life separating them for long years Unaware of the status of the club who kidnapped her she is constantly looking behind her back expecting that one day they will find her and force her back Or Rebel will find her and demand his money back that she stole from him The later happens and suddenly she is completely consumed by those old feelings only he fires in her blood It isn t long before danger crosses their paths and both of them end up fighting common enemies Ginger may harbor unspoken wishes for a future with the untameable nomad but realistically she knows it isn t possible With Rebel continually rushing to her aid each time she needs it effortlessly caring for her in every possible way soon hope flares bright But threats must be thwarted and as soon as one knocks out another appears If they can ever reach some level of normalcy maybe then the slightest possibility of a future could be explored And Ginger would be in for that scenario one hundred percent no questions asked Rebel claimed Ginger four years ago when he was ordered to brutalize her Except he didn t brutalize her he seduced her instead as a way to protect her He s been looking for her since he lost her and now that he s found her he isn t letting her go But his mind and heart are at war with one another His heart knows what it wants but his mind keeps insisting he isn t the type to settle down More than that he doesn t deserve the happiness Ginger inspires within him And still he can t let her go When her life is endangered multiple times he has no choice but to react and that means calling in his brothers Fighting an unknown villain and unmasking a couple of other mutual enemies is a lot to deal with in a short amount of time But if Rebel and his brothers are anything they are relentless and none of them will back down until justice has been served on a platter Another thing those brothers are good for besides having your back pulling one stubborn man s head out of a dark place and providing a swift kick to the nuts Maybe then he ll see just how right his beautiful spitfire is for him bruises baggage brotherhood and all For those of you who follow my reviews you are aware just how much I loved DARK MENACE MC STONE And praise the Lord Hallelujah Stone returns It s just for a bit and is basically revisiting events that have already happened but I cannot describe to you the huge grin that spread across my face when I realized what was happening I should have caught on from the beginning given Rebel is the male lead in this thrilling read but I was unaware of the time frame initially It didn t take me long to decipher the events as they unfolded though This book begins with about the first quarter toggling back and forth from four years ago to the present The events of four years ago is also parallel to the aforementioned book in which Rebel was deep undercover within the rival MC under the control of the nauseating Wildman I won t get into a retelling as most everything occurs within Stone s book but it was exciting for me to be able to see the other side of things I was always a bit curious as to what Rebel was going through undercover and very little was mentioned in the other book Rebel meets Ginger during that parallel time he was deep undercover somewhat controlled by Wildman but carefully speaking and acting in loyalty to Stone He had to participate in some horrific events but when he was able to tread on the lighter side of the darkness he was surrounded by he did and Ginger luckily fell into that category Claiming her began an addiction for them both that four years apart had little effect on I do wonder what happened after Rebel s time with Dark Menace Stone got him out from the Wild Marauders but he seems to have gone nomad after that Little to nothing was explained regarding his departure from Dark Menace so that would be my complaint with the book What the heck happened Stone is a terrific leader and cared about his brothers so why would anyone leave that MC Now some of you may be wondering if you have to read DARK MENACE MC STONE prior to this book given my comments However that is not the case You can read either one of them at any time without interfering with the other or fearing that anything will be missed Each of these books is a fabulous effort by Ms Richards She has her shit together writing within the world of these enthralling MCs and I highly recommend both this book as well as Stone s book I did not notice many editing errors but there was one oddity that continually popped up Several words ended with the letter y Why I have no idea Something like lety or noy or mey the words were let no and me so just dropping the y corrected the issue It was only slightly distracting and occurred maybe fifteen times or so I did convert the file from a pdf to my kindle though so maybe that caused the error I am unsure but curious if anyone else noticed it If it was meant to be a form of dialect it was completely lost on me Also brought into this story were several other Mc brothers some from the same MC some nomads like Rebel Enter Jace and Moody Jace I immediately took a liking to This was likely because he was given a bit more character than Moody was but the mystery of Moody also caught me This book is the first in a trilogy about the nomad bikers so assuming I am correct and I am sure I am then their books will follow My hope is that Jace is first and that Moody will be given more depth before digging into his story We will see when I get a chance to work my way through the next two books Speaking of character I do not have an overwhelming amount of experience with Ms Richards beyond the books I have read However so far I have yet to encounter someone I could describe as a strong female lead While Ginger initially presents as somewhat weak and feeble and obviously possesses a weakness with capital letters where Rebel is concerned Who wouldn t He s yummy I was pleasantly surprised to see her keep her head level and actually make a lot of progress in rescuing herself within some of her debacles She s a magnet for danger that s undeniable But her will to live and survive and not just crumble in the corner while waiting for Rebel to heroically show up on his metal steed was both inspiring and empowering So thank you Ms Richards for creating a woman who has enough grit to keep from falling to pieces as well as handle this rough and damaged biker As far as Rebel Damn He s perfectly ripped perfectly capable and perfectly tortured What s not to love I m a sucker for alphas though so he appeals in every way Even the almost endearing way he admits he loves Ginger but denies it within the same breath is fantastic It s actually a bit comical when you think about it Both of these survivors who have made their way through obstacles in life that others would run screaming from are too scared to voice their feelings thereby giving their deepest desires some level of tangibility fearing possible rejection And true to form this book is packed full of thrillingly hard core sex From their first meeting to the feeble attempts to resist after their separation to the explosive reignition the passion exhibited between Ginger and Rebel is off the charts hot It s rough and real much like our main characters are Fairly new to the MC romance genre I find myself pulled deeper and deeper under within this enigmatic world with each new acquisition and I have absolutely no plan to come up for air anytime soon For those of you who enjoy a little bit of dirty tossed in with a touch of suspense and a whole lot of erotica this is a world you must experience It may be ruthless in many ways but it hurts so good

4565,4565,"man I wouldn't be surprised if somehow ""the jade light"" turned Margulis into Natah and in some convoluted way the Lotus is \*actaully\* Margulis. maybe the jade light is a structure-ized form of the sentient light beam thing (like that splatted the original Umbra) but it actually also digitizes the person's mind (like a weird sort of transferrence) or something. then if Hunhow assimilated the structure, and seeing this seed of genius in the ""database"" of the machine, used it to spawn an offspring. I wouldn't be surprised if the end of the quest where we deal with Lotus again she ends up having been the uploaded mind of Margulis to begin with. I think it could be done really , the epic cinematics and such of Second Dream, and the ""journey"" portion of TWW. maybe introduce something where we realize we can transferrence into a Sentient-form , fight to where Lotus/Natah is, attempt to transferrence to reach her, flashbacks to the scene leading up to the execution, maybe someone telling her that she could retain her conciousness through the jade light if she was ready for it a certain way or , synchronized with her like a warframe, fight through a bunch of crap and do a TWW learning sequence and escape/rebellion , leaving an inert half-sentient frame that we can inhabit or something. probably wrong. but sounds plausible to me."

1060,1060,"Hello, Just want to say that if you need someone to talk to, feel free to message me. You are allowed to feel everything you are feeling. You still suffered from a loss. Don‚Äôt stress about your OH maybe not being on the same wavelength as you. It‚Äôs well known that the majority of men don‚Äôt feel 100% connected to a pregnancy until the last trimester. They have no physical connection with your bump unless it‚Äôs kicking. He will be doing the best he can. He too has experienced a loss, but the difference is it physically happened to you so you may be feeling more guilt and your hormones will be all over the place right now. I think the best thing you can do for yourself is go and speak to your GP. They will be able to help you find post abortion support. You may have a local free mental health service you can call/self refer to. It will be healthy for you to speak to someone impartially about what you are going through so you can process it. I do feel for you because when I found out I was pregnant, it seemed like babies were everywhere I went and everyone was having babies too. Keep the scan, pop it in a wee envelope and put it in a box for when you are ready to process things a bit better. I think the main issue with abortion is that it‚Äôs so taboo to speak about, so it can be very lonely to go through. You have made a massive decision with your partner and it‚Äôs all still very raw. With any loss, time is some kind of a healer, you don‚Äôt get over things but you adjust. Support each other and be kind to one another, but please look after yourself xxx"

9519,9519,"The Real Housewives of Potomac mom ditched her signature short blonde 'do for an ultra glamorous, long hairstyle. It looks like Robyn Dixon is channeling her inner hair chameleon to the fullest this season on The Real Housewives of Potomac. After introducing us to her date night alter ego, Tatiana, (who donned waist-length raven-hued strands) in the October 11 episode, Robyn hit us with another fabulous hair switch-up. For her latest interview look, Robyn traded her signature short blonde 'do for a Rapunzel-length style and a new hair color. The house flipper spilled her tea while sporting a sleek low ponytail with cascading waves that fell down to her waist. Her look also featured a fresh stunning light brown hair color we've never seen her with before. Although we're used to seeing Robyn with bright blonde strands, this caramel shade perfectly complemented her warm complexion. Robyn paired her fierce new hairstyle with a sequined metallic silver animal print dress featuring statement shoulder pads, which she paired with silver hoop earrings. She topped it all off with bold black eyeliner, pink eyeshadow, and a glossy pink pout."

China¬ís response so far has been fairly modest and measured, at least considering the situation. The U.S. has implemented or announced tariffs on virtually everything China sells here, with average tariff rates not seen in generations. The Chinese, by contrast, have yet to deploy anything like the full range of tools at their disposal to offset Trump¬ís actions and hurt his political base.

11847,11847,Article metrics Objective Research suggests human norovirus binding to histo blood group antigen HBGA like molecules on enteric bacteria may enhance viral pathogenesis however the properties of these bacterial ligands are not well known Previous work identified but did not characterize seven norovirus binding bacteria To further examine this bacteria virus binding interaction enteric bacteria were analyzed via Western blot with anti HBGA antibodies and lectins targeting HBGA associated sugar components Virus overlay assays using capsids from six different human norovirus strains further identified responsible ligands and strain dependent binding properties Results Each bacterial species possessed varying degrees of HBGA like activity and lectin binding further elucidated potential sugar residues involved N acetyl galactosamine Œ± d galactose or Œ± l fucose Both GI and GII norovirus capsids bound specific bacterial ligand sizes and generally corresponded to anti HBGA Western blot patterns A kDa band reacted with all HBGA antibodies bound all six of the noroviruses tested and had a high affinity for the lectins Collectively this work characterizes the varying carbohydrate residues potentially responsible for norovirus bacteria interactions and provides a basis for future ligand identification Introduction Human norovirus is the leading cause of viral gastroenteritis worldwide yet there are still multiple questions related to its pathogenicity Researchers identified a putative cellular receptor for human norovirus histo blood group antigens HBGAs the polymorphic terminal glycans found on red blood cells gastrointestinal cells and secreted in saliva among other tissues and organs Subsequent studies demonstrated the underlying complexities of the HBGA norovirus relationship HBGA like moieties are found in other animals plants and bacteria but the potential relevance to human norovirus has only been recently explored Initial studies demonstrated various human norovirus virus like particles VLPs bind to the exopolysaccharide layer of Enterobacter cloacae prompting the development of a putative cell culture model capable of productive human norovirus replication in the presence of either synthetic HBGAs or heat killed E cloacae This work suggests luminal HBGAs and a bacterial component may work in tandem during a norovirus infection while additional studies focused on identifying other bacteria capable of similar interactions While these studies collectively suggest versatility of the norovirus bacteria interaction the selected bacteria make up a small portion of the thousands of species present in the human gastrointestinal tract The findings reported here build upon a recent study on a larger more diverse set of bacterial species representative of the human gut The purpose of this study was to further characterize the nature of human norovirus bacteria binding and identify a basis for future bacterial ligand identification Main text Materials and methods Virus like particles VLPs and antibodies Ab3912 and NS14 were provided courtesy of Dr Robert Atmar Baylor College of Medicine Houston TX USA Abcam antibodies corresponded to blood groups AB ab24223 B ab24224 H ab24213 Lewis a ab2967 Lewis b ab3968 and Lewis y ab3359 Blood group A and Lewis x antibodies failed to interact with each respective positive control and were omitted Reference strains Staphylococcus aureus ATCC and Enterobacter cloacae ATCC in addition to five previously isolated strains Klebsiella spp Bacillus spp Enterococcus faecium Citrobacter spp and Hafnia alvei were used in this study Bacteria were grown aerobically at ¬∞C overnight in ml of half strength tryptic soy broth TSB Overnight cultures were centrifuged and resuspended in ml of chilled √ó phosphate buffered saline PBS pH then sonicated at an amplitude setting of for s followed by s on ice for seven rounds Sonicates were mixed with Laemmli buffer Bio Rad Laboratories and boiled for min ¬µl aliquots were loaded into mini PROTEAN TGX gels Bio Rad Laboratories with a spectra multicolor broad range ladder Thermo Fisher Scientific then run at V in a Tris glycine buffer Western blots were performed at room temperature using HBGA primary antibodies and lectins SDS PAGE protein gels were transferred to Œºm nitrocellulose membranes and blocked at ¬∞C overnight in SuperBlock Thermo Fisher Scientific The membranes were incubated for h with PBS containing skim milk Tween and a ratio of the appropriate primary antibody Membranes were washed thrice in PBS Tween PBS T then exposed to secondary antibody Anti mouse IgG alkaline phosphatase Sigma Aldrich diluted in PBS with skim milk Tween for h Membranes were washed and developed with BCIP NBT solution MP Biomedicals Biotinylated HBGAs A B or H Glycotech were included as positive controls while growth media previously shown to contribute to blood group activity was included as a negative control Lectins are highly specific sugar binding proteins To determine if individual sugars could be linked to norovirus binding a Western protocol utilized Œºg of biotinylated lectins isolated from Bandeiraea simplicifolia Sigma Aldrich Dolichos biflorus Bio world and Ulex europaeus agglutinin Vector Laboratories in place of primary antibody and streptavidin conjugated horseradish peroxidase Invitrogen at a dilution followed by addition of TMB Blotting Substrate Solution Thermo Fisher for signal development HBGAs containing positive or missing negative the sugar of interest were used as controls Bacterial binding of anti HBGA antibodies is only relevant to a potential infection model if these same residues also bind to norovirus To elucidate this relationship a virus overlay protocol was adapted from Kikkert et al The nitrocellulose membrane was washed in binding buffer mM Tris HCl pH mM NaCl mM dithiothreitol DTT mM EDTA Tween then washed four times in renaturation buffer mM Tris HCl pH mM NaCl mM DTT mM EDTA and incubated overnight The blot was washed twice in skim milk Tween followed by a min incubation in overlay buffer skim milk Tween polyvinylpyrrolidone Diluted VLPs Œºg ml were added to the overlay buffer incubated with the blot for h washed as before and exposed to primary antibody Ab3912 GI 1 GI 6 GI 7 and NS14 GII 1 GII 4 Sydney GII 4 Grimsby GII 17 and developed as described As a positive control Œºl of diluted norovirus antibody was included in each blot for viral adherence Growth media was included as a negative control An overlay was completed with the norovirus surrogate MS as an additional negative control Results and discussion These results are consistent with early studies documenting that HBGA like molecules occur commonly in bacterial species and are consistent with more recent studies suggesting HBGA like activity differs by bacterial strain The observed HBGA activity was unique to each bacterium based on the number of anti HBGA reactive bands and the molecular weight ranging from to kDa of each reactive band Table Additional file All bacteria tested interacted with at least two different anti HBGA antibodies although the intensity and size of each band differs Table Fig a Each bacterium tested possessed its own HBGA profile with similarities observed between the Gram negative Enterobacteriaceae tested however no discernable binding pattern emerged amongst the Gram positives This observation supports previous research highlighting Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria interacting with norovirus using different mechanisms as VLPs were found in association with the outer membrane of both S aureus and E faecium while preferentially binding to protruding structures in Gram negative bacteria Despite the differences observed a kDa band was present in six of the seven bacteria tested and all of the anti HBGA banding patterns The outlier E faecium possessed the overall lowest degree of HBGA like activity Table Fig a Additional file Table Bacterial HBGA and lectin binding activity with corresponding Western blot band size

Budget will be about 3k and due to the nature of what I'm selling it would be nice if this were to become an heirloom for the kids so it would be nice to buy new, but not essential since it will restrict my options. The criteria: -40mm preferably, possibly 42 but depends on lug-to-lug being less than 50mm, 48mm being the sweet spot. -something distinctive/different from the norm -Dressy but not an all-out dress watch.

3839,3839,Ambassador Adams clicked his fingernails against the metal table before him The room was quiet and if he hadn t been nervous already the silence of the space would have bothered him When he had landed his current job he thought his days being interviewed were over that he would never be on this side of the desk again Unfortunately a few months before his retirement humanity had discovered faster than light travel His days of discussing foreign policy with men and women of a similar rank were over Suddenly his once peaceful life was filled with meeting after meeting world leaders filling past his office in chattering droves People were replaced offices shuffled and dispersed to put up the best front possible for the galaxy to observe Somehow despite the flakes of grey in his once black hair and the wrinkles the spread from his deep blue eyes Theodore Adams had survived the cull He still had a wooden desk with his name on it and an office well stocked with all the alcohol and staff a high ranking ambassador needed in his day to day activities His suit was some of the finest humanity could produce wrinkle free and fitted to his skinny frame as though he had been born with it It was his armor his uniform but looking to the creature before him it made him feel like a child It lacked the sparkling gems that littered his counterpart s garments the fine designs and charms sewn into the fabric If the clothing had been on a human it would have seemed gaudy too ostentatious and only what the royalty of past ages would have worn But on the form sitting across from him It had the desired effect It was intimidating a show of wealth and power that made the man aware of just how small he was how inadequate he was to fill the shoes others had set before him The alien clicked its teeth which was either a laugh or a cough the translator chattering in his ear struggling to keep up They had been given a list of mannerisms and common phrases when they had been contacted but systems took a long time to configure One day perhaps the voice in his ear would be made by a machine but for now the crude headphone was manned by one of the finest linguists on the planet Adams was surprised when the creature spoke in English Accented heavily and with a tongue obviously struggling to make a few of the requisite shapes but understandable He heard an audible sigh from his earpiece a prayer of some kind answered Ambassador Adams the creature began its neck bulging as it pressed air through it mouth flat teeth trying to replicate a smile only unnerving the small man further You have been selected by your species to help us process your application into the greater Kaldani Trade Union We have studied your planet for some time bursts of warped space time tend to attract our attention We like what we see but tradition and protocol limited us in contacting you When your ship made it to the edge of your owned space and back you passed the first test Adams spoke up his voice much higher than the large creatures booming tone Test Yes a test the alien replied There are more but your species already covers most of the bases We need to process our applicants thoroughly Species admitted must be of a certain standard this you can understand yes Adams prickled his eyes narrowing unsure what the strange being was alluding too In days leading up to this meeting he had been inundated with a million scenarios If the society he was to meet with was peaceful or not whether they simply wanted an exchange or this was just a formality before war was declared He had been given the right to hand over some concessions if it meant humanities survival and something about the creatures wording bothered him It seemed to sense this its eyes bulging a loud croaking noise emanating from a small speaker box on the table before it You do not understand Is it a mistranslation Let me fix this two webbed fingers slipped from under the desk placing a small blue box in front of the alien I can try to provide an example if that would help yes A whirring noise filled the room flickering blue light creating shapes in the desk a hologram built pixel by pixel as the padded fingers of the creature manipulated a dozen buttons below him Look yes These creatures on your planet what are they called Xindor the same croaking voice was pushed from the speaker box again A yes cows These creatures The blue light spun allowing Adams to see the full rotation of the chicken in front of him That s he began only for the alien to wave its fingers in a dismissive action If you know one personally I am sorry But we learned long ago that creatures such as this do not make good partners in any trade union We ve been to many a planet and seen many organisms Before we developed the tests our council began to fill up with creatures such as this Smarter than your average rock or plant yes but unable to think in the long term We spent about ten of your planets cycles gathering plant matter in an endless cycle to appease them And their goods were worthless We were amicable at first Paid them more than a fair price for the drawings they had made in the dirt Some claim they were a form of abstract art but I think that s bunk Maybe worth a few tonnes of Horun fruit but no more than that Adams was trying to keep his face straight It was a struggle Already the translator on the other end of his earpiece had cracked up been replaced by his assistant and then she too had been pulled away Now he had an angry voice of a general yelling in his one ear to explain the unprofessional conduct of his staff All the while a glowing chicken was slowing spinning before him and the alien he had been so scared of moments before explaining how his species had been scammed by little more than animals Are you in pain I apologized like I said if you knew one personally is your species that sensitive No worries But now you understand our tests yes Since we ve implemented them only one similar to your cows the two fingers gestured towards the glowing box on the table Has managed to make it our council And they were a fluke I assure you Adams wiped the back of his hand against his eyes calming himself down with all years of diplomatic training behind him Still the wide smile on his face was hard to remove With a shaking voice which he quickly calmed he spoke And we passed the first one What about the others We shall see the alien clicked its teeth again Again we like your species but we have learned to be careful We once came upon a bird that s the word yes Yes a bird that could mimic our speech Had us fooled for decades We cannot rule out that you re not one of those pretending to be some other species on your planet but not the true source of the intelligence there Do you lay eggs by any chance it asked rather suddenly catching Adams off guard We have gathered most of your information on your species from your media And a lot gives off conflicting data hence why we needed your help We have seen some interesting pictures of your species and eggs Do you eat your young too or just that of cows Adams sunk into his chair the once gruff voice of the general in his ear once again replaced with the voice of the linguist s assistant The older man had been caught just as off guard by the egg question and cracking up in front of his men wasn t the image he wanted As the alien asked more and more strange questions Adams struggled to answer with his smile only growing Humanity had been welcomed into the galaxy but it had been welcomed by idiots

12077,12077,Dear Nancy Pelosi You Don t Need To Pay A Pint For Good Ice Cream Bad optics and lacking leadership during this time of crisis aside someone needs to tell the House speaker there are better cheaper options to stock her freezer with Madeline OsburnBy Madeline Osburn APRIL House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was slammed by lawmakers and media alike this week after she simultaneously blocked funds for America s suffering small businesses and showed off her gourmet ice cream stockpile House Republicans have attempted for over a week to pass a clean funding bill to replenish funds for the Paycheck Protection Program of which all billion available was officially depleted on Thursday Democrats blocked the assistance offering a counter proposal with a wish list of progressive propositions As Republicans and even some Democrats begged for Congress to bail out more small businesses Pelosi called it a stunt and claimed there s no data as to why we need it Meanwhile in an undeniably tone deaf move the millionaire congresswoman from California appeared on CBS Late Late Show Monday standing in front of a refrigerator that costs more than many Americans earn in a year and opened her freezer to reveal it was full to the brim with ice cream and gelato Clearly the staffer that thought this was a cute idea has yet to lose their own paycheck like million other Americans or at least they hadn t until this video aired Not to mention any experienced communications staffer would also know the last time a politician indulged in ice cream gluttony it made blaring headlines PRESIDENT GETS SCOOPS OF ICE CREAM EVERYONE ELSE as CNN s chyron once read Of course Pelosi should be shamed for her bad politics and lacking leadership during this time of crisis but I m here to talk about ice cream Any ice cream connoisseur took one look at Pelosi s freezer and saw stacks of cash Jeni s Splendid Ice Creams the colorful pints you see on the right cost per pint in the grocery store or for pints if you mail order like the Speaker suggests in the interview Talenti gelato which she points out as her two chocolate favorites on the left are a pint but still on the higher end of grocery story options I will concede Jeni s is very good ice cream It s a premium Philadelphia style ice cream which means it doesn t contain any eggs or yolks It has a creamy and smooth texture some even complain too creamy Jeni herself describes it as a buttercream body Their flavors are top notch and are often perfect balances of salty and sweet like the popular Brown Butter Almond Brittle So I do not blame Pelosi for her obsession one bit but there are other amazing less expensive options Blue Bell As a resident Texan my first recommendation has to be Blue Bell The little creamery in small town Brenham Texas only delivers to southern states to which it can drive within a day and California is not included but Pelosi has already established she s happy to mail order A pint of Blue Bell will cost you a half gallon and you will not be sacrificing an ounce of flavor or texture When Blue Bell had to halt production in after a deadly listeria outbreak some Texans hoarded their dwindling supplies while others auctioned off their half eaten cartons on eBay to the deprived It was devastating and Texans collectively fought for the company to make a comeback When freezer aisles were finally restocked one Kroger public relations rep said customers had vocal reactions exclaiming God is Good or Amen So yes it s that good for costing a pint Tillamook Despite churning out cheese and other dairy products for over years Tillamook recently relaunched and rebranded itself into the ice cream competition and quite successfully It has a soft fluffy texture almost as if it s been whipped but doesn t lose it s creaminess And a whole quart costs H agen Dazs H agen Dazs will do in a pinch and let s be honest it just sounds like something Nancy Pelosi would like It s also Ina Garten approved Being so creamy and thick it just tastes expensive and it s usually to a pint Pricey but not Jeni s pricey Snicker Ice Cream Bar This winner may be surprising but the Snickers ice cream bar specifically the Snickers Dark ice cream bar takes first place in the novelty frozen treat category They re only for six at Walmart and you can often find them for an even better price at Sam s Club or Costco This dark chocolate bar filled with peanut butter chocolate ice cream peanuts and caramel is everything you want in flavor and texture Plus you can eat it right out of the wrapper No need to even get a scoop involved Nancy Make Your Own Ice Cream I would hope that if Pelosi has a refrigerator she also has an ice cream maker somewhere in that chef s kitchen Homemade ice cream is undoubtedly the most delicious and cheapest ice cream At a time when we are all baking our own bread and cutting our own hair making our own ice cream is on the horizon with warming months of social distancing approaching There are countless easy recipes and you can make as much as you want for pennies on the dollar If all else fails and you re still missing the pint confection try making Jeni s Splendid Ice Cream at home Support Small Ice Cream Businesses Obviously Pelosi is in no real need of ice cream recommendations as we ve just seen some of her most extravagant assets But perhaps she can finally get around to doing what she s stalled on for over a week and support American small businesses like her local ice cream shop If she won t give them a loan so they can make payroll she could at least buy a scoop Maybe even leave a tip I m sure they will even sell it to her by the pint to put in her safe of sorbet

4836,4836,Open Access MIF CD74 axis is a target for novel therapies in colon carcinomatosis Fabio Bozzi DOI 6 s13046 z Background Strategies aimed at obtaining a complete cytoreduction are needed to improve long term survival for patients with colorectal cancer peritoneal carcinomatosis CRC pc Methods We established organoid models from peritoneal metastases of two na√Øve CRC patients A standard paraffin inclusion was conducted to compare their D structure and immunohistochemical profile with that of the corresponding surgical samples RNA expression levels of the CRC stem cell marker LGR5 was measured by in situ hybridization The secretome of organoids was profiled by mass spectrometry Energy homeostasis of organoids was interfered with IPP and metformin Biochemical and metabolic changes after drug treatments were investigated by western blot and mass spectrometry Mitochondria impairment was evaluated by electron microscopy and mitotraker staining Results The two organoids recapitulated their corresponding clinical samples in terms of D structure and immmunoistochemical profile and were positive for the cancer stem cells marker LGR5 Proteomic analyses of organoids highlighted their strong dependence on energy producing pathways which suggest that their targeting could be an effective therapeutic approach To test this hypothesis we treated organoids with two drugs that target metabolism acting on AMP activated protein kinase AMPK the main regulator of cellular energy homeostasis which may act as metabolic tumour suppressor in CRC Organoids were treated with IPP an inhibitor of MIF CD74 signalling axis which activates AMPK function or metformin that inhibits mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I As a new finding we observed that treatment with IPP downregulated AMPK signalling activity reduced AKT phosphorylation and activated a JNK mediated stress signalling response thus generating mitochondrial impairment and cell death Metformin treatment enhanced AMPK activation decreasing the activity of the anabolic factors ribosomal protein S6 and p4EBP and inducing mitochondrial depolarization Conclusion We provide evidence that the modulation of AMPK activity may be a strategy for targeting metabolism of CRC pc organoids KeywordsOrganoidsMetabolismAMPK4 IPPMacrophage migration inhibitory factorMetformin Background Intraperitoneal dissemination is a common progression feature for colorectal cancer CRC For the past two decades aggressive treatments of CRC peritoneal carcinomatosis CRC pc such as cytoreductive surgery plus hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy has improved long term survival However the majority of cases present widespread metastases which cannot be destroyed by systemic chemotherapy therefore the development of new strategies to prevent the progression of metastatic disease is imperative Tumour initiating or cancer stem cells CSCs have a key role in metastatic CRC hepatic and or lung and chemotherapy resistance however limited information is known about the role of CSCs in CRC pc development The first step towards the identification of new therapeutic alternatives requires the development of dedicated pre clinical models that in vitro and in vivo recapitulate the biological features of CRC pc Past years have seen unprecedented developments of three dimensional D cultures called cancer organoids A CRC organoid is obtained by allowing cells derived from a primary tumour specimen to self organize into a D structure that recapitulates the original glandular organization commonly observed in human CRC surgical samples Organoids grow as irregular compact structures and can be expanded indefinitely and represent the physiology of native tumours much better than traditional cell lines We have established in serum free medium two CRC pc organoid cultures of peritoneal metastatic lesions from two CRC patients that showed enrichment in the expression of the CRC CSC marker leucine rich repeat containing G protein coupled receptor LGR5 a member of the canonical WNT pathway and a well recognized marker of the cell progenitor population located at the crypt base In this study we hypothesized that CRC organoids may secrete a variety of growth factors cytokines proangiogenic factors exosomes and even extracellular matrix components some of which are fundamental for maintaining self renewal and proliferative capacity Using the advantageous properties of serum free growth conditions for both organoids we searched for factors with potential therapeutic relevance in their secretome compartment produced during cell culture We found the prominent expression of metabolic pathways mainly related to oxidative homeostasis and glucose metabolism and focused on the macrophage migration inhibitory factor MIF CD74 mitochondria axis and on the relative iodo phenylpyrimidine IPP inhibitor as playing an important role in JNK modulation of the cellular response to reactive oxygen species To further examine the importance of targeting metabolism in organoids we studied the effects of direct perturbation of mitochondrial integrity using metformin which inhibits respiratory chain complex I thus inducing a pro cell death decline in energy status Methods Cell culture and tissue samples Two cancer organoids CRC pc1 and CRC pc2 hereinafter referred to as C1 and C2 were established from peritoneal metastases of na√Øve patients with stage IV grade C1 and grade C2 CRC following protocols and conditions published by Sato T et al BRAF and KRAS mutation patterns in organoids reflected those in the original tumours Formalin fixed paraffin embedded FFPE tissue samples obtained from additional CRC pc patients C3 C4 and C5 were included in the study for validation experiments The two organoids were maintained in F medium DMEM F12 Gibco Carlsbad CA USA as previously described This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori and each patient provided written informed consent to donate remaining tissues after diagnostic procedures Morphology and immunohistochemistry A standard paraffin inclusion of both organoids was conducted to compare their D structure and immunohistochemical profile with those of the corresponding surgical samples Immunohistochemistry was done with Œºm FFPE tissue sections The antibodies used for immunohistochemistry analyses are listed in Additional file Table S1 In Situ Hybridization ISH ISH for LGR5 RNA expression was manually performed using the RNAscope High Definition detection kit Brown Advanced Cell Diagnostics Inc Hayward CA assay according to the manufacturer s instructions Briefly Œºm FFPE

cultured for h and exposed to drugs for the times indicated Cell pellets were solubilized as previously described Protein concentrations SDS PAGE and electroblotting were determined and performed as previously described The antibodies used for western blotting analyses are listed in Additional file Table S2 Trypan blue exclusion A standard trypan blue exclusion assay was used to evaluate cell viability after IPP and metformin treatments Data were analyzed using Student s t test Drug treatments For cell treatments mM of iodo phenylpyrimidine IPP Calbiochem Milan Italy and M metformin Sigma Aldrich St Louis MO USA in DMSO and in PBS √ó respectively were diluted directly in the cell culture medium to achieve the working concentrations The final solvent and vehicle concentrations were less than for all samples including controls Isotope dilution mass spectrometry analysis C2 organoids were treated with or ŒºM IPP and mM metformin After h treated cells were lysed and the lysates were analysed by isotope dilution mass spectrometry as previously described Reactive oxygen species detection C2 organoids were seeded into a well plate After h cells were treated with mM metformin for h and with ŒºM IPP for h Extracellular H2O2 formation was detected and quantified using the ROS Glo H2O2 assay Promega Madison WI USA according to instructions provided by the manufacturer Luminescence intensity was quantified using a microplate reader Infinite TECAN Group Ltd M√§nnedorf Switzerland Mitochondrial membrane potential analysis Mitochondrial membrane potential of cells was detected using a MitoProbe‚Ñ¢ JC Assay Kit for flow cytometry Thermo Fisher Scientific Corporation Carlsbad CA USA after treatment with drugs for the times indicated Flow cytometry analyses were performed as previously described Electron microscopy Cells were fixed by addition of glutaraldehyde in M cacodylate buffer pH for h Next samples were post fixed with reduced OsO4 for h Osmium staining was treated with thiocarbohydrazide in O 2 M cacodylate buffer pH for min Finally cells were treated with the reduced OsO4 for h in the darkness and placed ethanol which was gradually replaced by and ethanol After this dehydratation samples were embedded in Epon After h polymerization at ¬∞C samples were cut using Leica FC6 ultramicrotome Leica Wien Austria and examined in Tecnai transmission electron microscope FEI Endhoven The Netherland Mitotracker staining and confocal microscopy C2 cells were plated in mm Petri dishes √ó cells well incubated for h before treatment with or ŒºM IPP h or with mM metformin h The cells were stained with MitoTracker Deep Red FM Molecular Probes Invitrogen Carlsbad CA USA at a final concentration of nM then fixed with paraformaldehyde at ¬∞C for min and washed with phosphate buffered saline Immunofluorescence staining was performed on Œºm paraffin embedded sections deparaffinised in xylene and rehydrated in graded alcohols The slides were washed in M phosphate buffered saline incubated with DAPI Molecular Probes for min washed again in M phosphate buffered saline and then fixed using Prolong Antifade Molecular Probes Confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed using the Leica TCS SP8 X microscope Leica Microsystems GmbH Mannheim Germany Results D structures IHC profile and LGR5 expression of the organoids In phase contrast microscopy showed both tubular branched and more round shaped D structures present in C1 while C2 was mainly composed of round shaped cellular aggregates Additional file Figure S1 After paraffin inclusion C1 organoids exhibited glandular structures lined by pseudostratified columnar cells with central fibrinoid core and dirty necrosis along with roundish solid aggregates of not aligned tumour cells These features mirrored those present in the corresponding histologic sample Fig a In C2 organoids the cells exhibited adhesion loss and were organized in ring and or ribbon like structures The corresponding sample showed solid nests of poorly differentiated cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm surrounded by desmoplastic stroma infiltrating omental fat Fig b Both organoids expressed Cytokeratins CK A1 A3 ‚àí ‚àí Fig and Claudin and were negative for CK7 and Paired Box PAX8 data not shown C1 retained a high expression of Caudal Type Homeobox CDX2 compared to C2 Finally according to the observed rapid growth both organoids had a very high Ki staining Mib1 Fig Fig Immunohistochemical profile of FFPE sections from C1 and C2 organoids and corresponding surgical samples

sample Magnifications at X By ISH we investigated the expression of LRG5 the marker of the cell progenitor population located at the crypt base LRG5 RNA expression was observed in both organoids Fig C1 displayed a gradient of LRG5 staining that was stronger in the peripheral sheet of epithelial cells compared to more luminal sheets Conversely C2 LGR5 was very focally expressed by some apical and peripheral organoid cells resulting in a more heterogeneus staining Transcription of LGR5 was also confirmed in their corresponding clinical FFPE materials Fig Fig In situ hybridization in situ hybridization of LGR5 on FFPE sections of C1 and C2 organoids and of the surgical specimens from which they originated Taking advantage from the serum free growth conditions of CRC pc organoids we profiled the secretome compartment to search for novel molecular candidates for therapy involved in CRC pc development and coupled it with a classical pharmacological approach aimed at exploring the possible implications of these candidates in CRC pc Indeed we also used C1 organoids for validating the results obtained from the use of C2 We stated that these proteins playing a role in crucial biological processes were secreted by organoids and that they were present also in clinical samples These studies support the concept that CRC pc organoids may constitute a pre clinical model for investigating the biology of CRC derived peritoneal lesions Over represented biological processes identified by secretome in C2 organoids The secretome composition of C2 organoids was investigated using a classical bottom up proteomic analysis with LC Orbitrap mass spectrometry Of the items were recognized as proteins with GO extracellular space by STRING Fig a PANTHER assessed overrepresentation of proteins involved in Parkinson disease glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathways Fig b These results are consistent with the previous observation that functions related to glucose metabolism and mitochondria homeostasis are downregulated in neurodegeneration including Parkinson s disease PD but upregulated in colorectal cancer Fig Over represented Gene Ontologies and pathways in the secretome of C2 organoids a Gene Ontology analysis of secreted proteins The Search Tool for the Retrieval of INteracting Genes proteins STRING database was used for prediction of protein subcellular localization STRING confidence score represented the probability of finding functional modules that were selected if the significance p value of GO enrichment was less than Statistical significance was ascertained with a false discovery rate FDR threshold of < b PANTHER overrepresentation test Proteins involved in metabolic process and regulation of extracellular activities were also major components of the C2 secretome The table shows the most representative identified overrepresented categories of proteins involved in Parkinson disease glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathways Experiments were performed in duplicate Data were considerate significant when p ‚â§ c Network analysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software The analysis shows the connection between the MIF DDT MIF with AMPK embedded within the network The network predicts the potential value and validity of the MIF AMPK connection d Summary of the modulation of AMPK activity on organoids through MIF Analysis of the secreted proteins with annotations in the IPA database identified networks that were enriched in proteins involved in metabolism homeostasis protein ubiquitination cell cycle and DNA repair and were significantly over represented in cancer Additional file Figure S2 Macrophage migration inhibitory factor MIF CD74 signalling axis Secretome composition of C2 organoids included proteins potentially able to mediate high metabolic demand adaptive homeostasis along with enhancing stress resistance One of them was the multifunctional cytokine MIF Fig c the ligand of CD74 receptor MIF CD74 axis can promote cell survival by modulating glucose uptake and metabolism through the activation of AKT and AMPK proteins and is considered a potential target for therapy Fig c MIF and CD74 were expressed in C2 organoids and in the corresponding tumour tissue Fig a and b We then characterized key molecules involved in the downstream signalling cascade of the MIF CD74 complex As expected C2 organoids exhibited AKT and AMPK specific phosphorylation respectively at positions S473 and T172 Fig a and suppression of JNK activity due to MIF mediated inhibition of JAB1 data not shown Fig Effects of IPP and metformin on C2 organoids a MIF CD74 signaling in C2 organoids Lysates from C2 organoids expressed MIF CD74 and presented activated AKT and AMPK b Hematoxylin eosin and immunohistochemical staining of C2 tumour sample with anti MIF and anti CD74 antibodies Magnifications at X c Micrographs of C2 organoids before and after drug treatments IPP and metformin treatments induced a marked morphological change in C2 organoids resulting in a loss of their original spheroid organization Magnifications X Scale bars = Œºm d C2 organoids were treated with mM metformin for h or and ŒºM IPP for and h The percentage of cell death was determined by trypan blue exclusion assay Data are expressed as the mean ¬± SD P < compared with untreated control and ŒºM IPP P < compared with untreated control and ŒºM IPP We have not observed significant increase in the percentage of cell death after metformin treatments compared with untreated controls All the experiments were replicated at least three times e Immunoblots of the principal proteins involved in CD74 MIF pathway C2 organoids were untreated or treated with and ŒºM IPP for h lysates were resolved by SDS PAGE and immunoblotted f Immunoblots of the principal proteins involved in metformin pathway C2 organoids were untreated or treated with mM metformin for h lysates were resolved by SDS PAGE and immunoblotted g Global tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation changes in C2 organoids after IPP and metformin treatments C2 organoids were untreated or treated with and ŒºM IPP for h and with mM metformin for h lysates were resolved by SDS PAGE and immunoblotted h Immunoblots showing the expression and activity of the PP2A and PP1 proteins before and after IPP or metformin treatments Blots are representative of the results from multiple at least two experiments i Observed consequences of the IPP or metformin treatments on C2 organoids Since MIF CD74 axis through AMPK activation accelerates glucose uptake which enhances mitochondrial functions we assessed whether the MIF CD74 axis supports and maintains high levels of metabolism of C2 organoids We have recently observed an extensive alteration of some crucial oncogenic signals and a decrease in Krebs cycle activity through the specific inhibition of MIF activity using IPP in papillary and anaplastic thyroids carcinoma models In the work we demonstrated by MALDI TOF analysis that IPP can effectively recognize MIF as its target We expect that targeting MIF CD74 axis in CRC pc models could give similar results inducing a strong impairment in many crucial metabolic pathways and leading to a dramatic change of the homeostasis of colonic carcinomatosis Conversely we examined the effects of AMPK stimulation by using metformin an AMPK activator that disrupts mitochondrial functions through inactivating mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I Cellular and signalling effects of IPP and Metformin on C2 organoids We evaluated the IPP effects by targeting C2 organoids with various concentrations of inhibitor ŒºM Twenty four hours after treatment with IPP C2 organoids appeared disaggregated Fig c left and died within h The disaggregation of organoids was also observed after treatment with metformin that on the other hand induced only a slight increase of cell death after h Trypan blue assay Fig d Treatment with and ŒºM IPP activated ERK phosphorylation In contrast AKT and AMPK phosphorylation was abrogated Fig e The decreased phosphorylation of the AKT specific phosphorylation site on FOXO3 further demonstrated the suppression of AKT activity and possibly supported the impairment of C2 viability Shorter IPP treatments and h exhibited similar results Additional file Figure S3 Treatment of C2 organoids with metformin inhibited phosphorylation of mTOR ribosome protein S6 and E BP1 but did not inhibit ERK and AKT Fig f Treatments with IPP increased the activity of the stress activated protein kinase JNK in a dose dependent manner explainable by the activation of a complete stress related response Fig e In parallel a dramatic change in the anti phosphotyrosine phosphothreonine profile was observed probably due to inhibited phosphatase activities Fig g left panel Indeed PP2A phosphorylation was switched off after IPP treatment Fig h left panel Conversely metformin treatment did not significantly modify phosphotyrosine phosphothreonine profiles and phosphorylation of PP2A and PPP1A Fig g and h right panels These results suggested that inhibition of AKT and AMPK related pathways has more pronounced effects in terms of cell survival and stress related response rather than the implementation of AMPK mTOR S6 EBP1 axis Fig i Metabolic changes after IPP and metformin treatments To investigate the metabolic effects of the two drugs we analysed the cellular amount of some metabolites involved in glycolysis tricarboxylic acid TCA cycle fatty acids FAs and cholesterol synthesis in lysates from C2 organoids after IPP and metformin treatments by isotope dilution gas chromatography mass spectrometry GC MS analysis After IPP treatment glycerol phosphate and pyruvate were elevated and citrate fumarate malate and succinate were reduced Fig and Additional file Table S3 Conversely after metformin treatment lactic acid and glycerol phosphate were elevated and pyruvate succinate fumarate malate and citrate were reduced IPP treated C2 organoids showed a moderate reduction in fatty acids and cholesterol synthesis while exposure to metformin resulted in reduced fatty acid levels and cholesterol synthesis that were more pronounced than that observed in cells treated with IPP Fig and Additional file Table S3 Metformin treatment reduced cholesterol synthesis measured as the cellular amount of cholesterol precursor lathosterol lanosterol and desmosterol as well as the amount of cholesterol and membrane fatty acids which are part of phospholipids structural molecule of the lipid bilayer It is likely that the alterations to the cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism may be both the consequence as well as a mechanism to induce the mitochondrial dysfunction in tumour cells exposed to metformin Moreover the increase of pyruvate followed by the strong impairment in the production of the principal metabolites involved in the TCA cycle in C2 organoids after IPP treatment seems to be related to a mitochondria disruption provoked by the knock down of MIF activity Fig Metabolic changes after IPP or metformin treatments The figure shows the bargraphs relative of the metabolites analysed by mass spectrometry after C2 treatments with IPP at ŒºM for h and metformin at mM for h Values are expressed as ng mg proteins and are normalized to the value of total proteins present in each sample Each value represents the mean of five independent replicates Metabolites values are also plotted blue bars mark the amount with respect to the highest values Metabolic organic acids intermediates of the TCA cycle citrate succinate and fumarate were reduced both in IPP and metformin treated cells In the case of metformin treated cells there was a significant increase in lactate production suggestive of an inefficient pyruvate dehidrogenase activity due to impaired TCA and OXPHOS Citrate released by mitochondria is converted into Acetyl CoA NADPH and ATP for lipid cholesterol and fatty acids synthesis Cholesterol and precursor sterols markers of cholesterol synthesis were reduced in both IPP and metformin treated cells Very long chain fatty acids >C16 were reduced by both treatments Mitochondria impairment after IPP and metformin treatments in C2 organoids Because mitochondria are known to produce significant amounts of ROS that may generate oxidative stress contributing to mitochondrial damage affecting signal transduction pathways cellular functions and viability we studied the effects of the two compounds on ROS production Fig a ROS H2O2 Glo assay showed an increase of ROS production in C2 organoids after metformin and IPP treatments times This result suggests that C2 organoids undergo genotoxic stress due to rising levels of ROS Fig Mitochondria impairment after IPP and metformin treatments in C2 organoids a Reactive oxygen species detection with ROS H2O2 Glo assay kit C2 cells

treatment caused a significant increase in the amount of FITC aggregates a pattern that is characteristic for disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential d The ultrastructure of the C2 cells after IPP D1 or metformin treatment D4 and left untreated D7 The white arrows show autophagic structures and red stars indicate apoptotic bodies present in IPP treated cells White triangles show irregular mitochondria blue stars lipid droplets and the yellow star a multilamellar structure present in metformin treated cells Additionally no signs of autophagy apoptosis or irregular mitochondria were observed in untreated cells D7 e Functional consequences of IPP or metformin treatments on C2 organoids A mitochondrial targeted probe which accumulates in mitochondria depending on their membrane potential was used to morphologically explore the mitochondrial network in C2 organoids under IPP and metformin inhibition Briefly we monitored the mitochondrial membrane potential using JC1 probe a cationic carbocyanine fluorescent dye that exhibits a potential dependent accumulation in mitochondria a fluorescent emission shift from green ~ nm to red ~ nm indicates increase of the membrane potential while a decrease in the red green fluorescence intensity ratio highlights mitochondrial depolarization Our analyses showed that mitochondria were distributed broadly in the cytoplasm and characterized by a perinuclear punctuated network in untreated cells Fig b Cells treated with IPP showed mitochondria with an altered morphology indicated by changes in immunofluorescence staining patterns Mitochondria appeared much less tubular and a diffuse cytosolic pattern of fluorescence was observed Of note treated cells also showed signs of nuclear destruction Fig b left Metformin treatment decreased the fluorescence of the probe and several cells displayed a negative fluorescence signal Fig b right indicating a clear loss of mitochondrial membrane potential which is an important indicator of functional mitochondria The results highlighted a mitochondrial depolarization after metformin treatment Fig c Using electron microscopy to examine the morphology of mitochondria in C2 organoids treated with IPP we observed signs of necrosis including strong condensation of chromatin along a nuclear envelope There mitochondria were smaller than in non treated cells with significant impairment of their structure The number of lipid droplets in cytosol was smaller than in cells treated with metformin Fig D1 D3 In organoids treated with metformin we found many large mitochondria with irregular contours and a modest number of cristae These mitochondria contained multi lamellar structures inside and were aligned with residual lipid droplets accumulated inside the cytosol Fig D4 D6 These results suggested that ROS production likely due to the loss reduction of mitochondrial activity affected viability of C2 organoids Fig e Specifically IPP treated C2 organoids showed autophagy structures Fig d that are associated with necrosis and cell death IPP and metformin effects are recapitulated also in the C1 organoids To further evaluate the relevance of the results obtained through IPP and metformin we assessed whether IPP and metformin could inhibit the MIF CD74 signalling axis and AMPK respectively by determining their effects on the expression of targets also in C1 organoids Treatments impaired the principal morphological features of C1 organoids leading to loss of the spheroids organization Fig a and d Western blot analysis confirmed that IPP at and ŒºM increased ERK phosphorylation and down regulated AKT and AMPK activity Fig b Moreover in C1 organoids mM metformin inhibited the mTOR pathway and downregulated AKT and ERK activity Fig e As shown in Fig c the anti phosphotyrosine and anti phosphothreonine profiles of the IPP treated cells presented a significant increase in phosphorylated proteins profiles compared with control groups In parallel we observed the change of PP2A phosphorylation status indicating failed phosphatase activity data not shown Trypan blue assay also displayed that IPP treatments at and ŒºM strongly impaired C1 organoids viability after twenty four and forty eight hours On the other hand after one hundred and twenty hours mM metformin slightly affected C1 viability Fig d Taken together these results confirm the validity and reproducibility of treatments with IPP and metformin in colon cancer carcinomatosis derived organoids Fig IPP and metformin effects are recapitulated using C1 organoids a

for h The percentage of cell death was determined by trypan blue exclusion assay Data are expressed as the mean ¬± SD We have not observed significant increase in the percentage of cell death after metformin treatments compared with untreated controls All the experiments were replicated at least three times Immunohistochemical expression of CD74 and MIF was studied in three additional peritoneal CRC pcs C3 C4 and C5 along with their corresponding normal colon samples Fig In normal colon samples CD74 was widely and strongly expressed by both normal epithelial cells and the surrounding reactive cell microenvironment The lymphocytes were strongly CD74 positive The expression of CD74 in neoplastic tumour cells was heterogeneous ranging from strong cytoplasmic and membranous samples C4 and C5 to weak granular cytoplasmic sample C3 MIF was poorly expressed by normal epithelial cells Conversely all tumour cells exhibited cytoplasmic and membranous staining which ranged from weak to moderate and strong Fig CD74 and MIF IHC staining in three additional CRC pc samples In the upper part of the Figure the normal colon mucosa from the three patients is shown In all the cases CD74 is highly expressed in epithelial cells and in the surrounding normal cellular microenvironment Conversely MIF is poorly expressed MIF staining is mainly restricted to epithelial cells In the lower part of the figure the corresponding peritoneal carcinomatoses C3 C4 and C5 are shown Immunohistochemical staining for CD74 is heterogeneous with a granular cytoplasmic and membranous pattern in C3 while focal granular and restricted to the inner luminal aspect in C4 inset and C5 MIF immunostaining is homogeneous and very low expressed in C3 compared to C4 and C5 MIF staining is mainly cytoplasmic Images were taken using a Nikon Eclipse i microscope Nikon Tokyo Japan and Nikon digital sight DS Fi1 camera equipped with control unit DS L2 Nikon Images were assembled using Adobe Photoshop Adobe Systems San Jose CA USA Original magnification at X Discussion We explored the opportunity of using data from the secretome analysis of patient derived cancer organoids established from two peritoneal carcinomatosis C1 and C2 to identify possible targets for therapy The analysed organoids presented self renewal capacity the ability to form the typical D structure and a significant positivity for stem biomarkers as shown by the number of highly dividing LGR5+ CSCs especially in C2 organoids LGR5+ cells are believed to be fast cycling and resistant to irradiation and chemotherapy and have been shown to initiate intestinal organoid growth in a D culture system when isolated from the mouse small intestine This high proliferation suggests that LGR5+ cells are adapted to facilitate the uptake and incorporation of nutrients into the biomass nucleotide amino acids and lipids needed to generate new cells Remarkably this adaptation is not merely due to in vitro growth conditions but was a characteristic already present in the original tumours both presenting a high number of LGR5+ cells and high mitotic index Accordingly GO Analysis of the secretome profile of the fastest growing C2 organoids revealed prominent expression of metabolic pathways related to oxidative homeostasis glucose metabolism and the major glucose catabolic pathway pentose phosphate pathway that links glucose metabolism to biosynthesis of the nucleotide precursor ribose coordinating glucose flux and supporting the cellular biogenesis of macromolecules and energy production The simultaneous positivity of the two organoids for MIF suggests the rationale for inhibition of MIF CD74 signalling axis which is known to support AMPK activation glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation but also to compensate for the effects of high glucose oxidation AMPK activation enhances both the transcription and translocation of Glut4 with a consequent increase in glucose uptake which in turn activates the PI3K AKT pathway Activated AMPK is also responsible for initiating alternative energy generating processes such as fatty acid oxidation The activation of AMPK and the subsequent glycolytic switch observed in mitotic cells supports the possibility of a dependence on energy pathways to survive in mitosis AMPK senses ATP loss and enhances glycolysis to protect from death Previous research has shown that MIF acts through the AMPK signalling pathway to induce cellular resistance to glucose deprivation ischemia hypoxia oxidation and stress senescence Our results support the concept that CSCs through the expression of MIF and CD74 become protected by energy default processes which force cancer cells with defective mitochondria to generate energy through an AMPK regulated glycolysis in the cytoplasm Thus the inhibition of AMPK signalling through the suppression of MIF CD74 signalling could be a rational strategy that affects the special energetic requirements of C1 and C2 organoids Indeed knocking down MIF CD74 signalling through IPP decreased SOD1 and resulted in changes in mitochondrial morphology and mass An increase of ROS produced a JNK mediated stress response Fig The oxidative shift in the redox conditions reduced phosphatases activity blocking signal propagation in the cell through a number of signalling pathways involving protein kinases In both organoids the inhibition of AMPK mediated signalling is associated with the inactivation of both AKT and FOXO3 Of note FOXO3 can induce a number of genes that protect against ROS suggesting that it plays a role in keeping cellular ROS low JNK activation resulted after treatment possibly modulating cellular response to ROS independent of changes in the intracellular AMP level and likely inducing a defective autophagic process followed by rapid cell death ROS increase is also the cause of the observed inactivation of PP2A phosphatase and of the relevant consequences in terms of signal transduction response Inhibition of ERK1 dephosphorylation and the general inhibition of protein dephosphorylation observed after treatment support this interpretation of the results However redox regulation of phosphatases is poorly understood Protein phosphatases are inhibited by ROS which target specific redox sensitive amino acids but PP2A catalytic activity leading to the activation of cellular stress signalling pathways can be also modulated by hydrogen peroxide Our findings define a MIF CD74 AMPK pathway in the colon peritoneal carcinomatosis for the first time elucidating a signal transduction mechanism between autocrine paracrine factors and AMPK activation The results provide initial proof of concept that pharmacologic treatment blocking MIF CD74 signalling pathways disrupts energy homeostasis in CRC pc derived organoids in vitro by inducing cell death Our investigations were also aimed to study the effects of metformin a drug for treating type diabetes whose use has been associated with decreased cancer risk and that kills cancer initiating stem cells from a variety of cancers with AMPK activation Metformin is known to inhibit the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I that reduces ATP production and increases the intracellular ratio of AMP ATP resulting in AMPK activation that switches cells from an anabolic to a catabolic state We found that metformin reprograms organoid metabolism This process involved both AMPK activation which reduces mTOR activity and protein translation and complex I inhibition which promotes ROS production within the mitochondrial matrix As an effect of AMPK activation glycolysis was stimulated producing a large amount of lactate Furthermore the inhibition of complex I promoted superoxide production within the mitochondrial matrix which provoked dysfunctional mitochondrial swelling interrupted the tricarboxylic acid cycle and led to a compensatory increase in lactate and glycolytic ATP and aberrant lipid accumulation C2 organoids treated with metformin presented dramatic changes in mitochondria morphology deformation and partial loss of mitochondrial membranes and degradation of cristae Consequently we observed accumulation of free radicals and loss of membrane potential These effects could be explained by the ability of metformin to induce mitochondrial depolarization and increase ROS through inhibition of complex I which also leads to mitochondrial cristae degradation Loss of mitochondrial function limits the production of lipids nucleotides and amino acids used by cells for the creation of new biomass and could explain the inhibited cell proliferation after treatment with metformin as suggested by the reduced number of disaggregated cells counted in treated samples during the trypan blue assay data not shown In conclusion IPP and metformin have profound effects on the metabolism of organoids derived from CRC pcs Interestingly C1 and C2 organoids presented different phenotypic features but similar responses when treated with IPP or metformin activation of stress signalling pathways and cell death with IPP treatments inhibition of mitochondria oxidation of glucose and lipids resulting in energy restriction with metformin treatments We have previously shown that inhibition of MIF CD74 signalling axis blocks thyroid cancer cells growth by inducing cell death during mitosis Other studies have demonstrated the efficacy of MIF or CD74 targeting in several cancers providing a rationale for the development of therapeutic agents and clinical trials to study the effects of inhibiting a newly discovered MIF isoform oxMIF on different cancers including metastatic CRC NCT01765790 Milatuzumab the first anti CD74 antibody that has entered into clinical tests is currently being studied for the treatment of non Hodgkin lymphomas chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma and could be potentially tested in MIF CD74 positive CRC pc MIF inhibitors particularly when acting on the MIF CD74 axis could be a very attractive strategy for cancer therapeutic intervention due to the nonphysiologic enzymatic activity of the cytokine that is evolutionary well conserved MIF belongs to the family of tautomerase proteins and can catalyze the tautomerization of nonphysiologic substrates such as D dopachrome and L dopachrome methyl ester into their corresponding indole derivates This peculiar feature seems to be mediated by the NH2 terminal Proline of MIF Pro and strategies based on targeting Pro are able to abrogate the tautomerase activity Indeed different works have shown that the development of small molecules antagonist of the MIF enzymatic active site could be an effective strategy to abrogate its functions Winner and colleagues showed how IPP serves as suicide substrate for MIF resulting in the covalent modification of Pro Exposure to IPP decreased MIF immunoreactivity and similar results were also recapitulated using MIF silencing based strategies Some recent works showed how IPP interferes with several activities peculiar of MIF such as neutrophil lung recruitment the maintenance of a chemoresistant phenotype and the reprogramming of tumor associated macrophages that supports malignant plasma cell survival and resistance to therapy in multiple myeloma cells Moreover MIF inhibitors particularly in conjunction with CD74 inhibition could be very efficient in blocking CRC pc progression The systemic effects of inhibitors that interfere with energy metabolism are still only partially known however ongoing clinical studies seem to give encouraging results Differently metformin is widely used with mild or no side effects and therefore the effects of energetic reduction induced by metformin on organoids could be combined with drugs which can act in synergy and induce cell death Conclusions Our study shows that the modulation of AMPK function both through its activation by metformin or its reduction caused by the removal of MIF CD74 signalling axis is critical for maintaining cell energy balance of CRC pc Metformin elicits the metabolic reprogramming by decreasing oxidative phosphorylation and increasing dependency on glycolytic metabolism Conversely inhibition of MIF CD74 signalling axis elevated ROS rendering cancer cells vulnerable to oxidative stress induced cell death In conclusion targeting the metabolism of cancer cells opens new lines of research that could lead to the design of new therapies for the treatment of CRC pc Abbreviations
14,14,In December five people of Chinese ancestry died of bubonic plague in Honolulu The Honolulu Board of Health reacted by deploying the U S military to lock down a fourteen block neighborhood containing people predominantly Chinese and Japanese Authorities then attempted to systematically burn down buildings in the quarantined zone to purge the plague But as officials tried to set controlled burns the wind picked up and set all of Honolulu s Chinatown aflame The fire raged for seventeen days It ultimately demolished acres destroying homes and leaving people homeless It also spread the plague a U S Public Health Service PHS official concluded that rats driven out by the fire had carried the disease into the rest of the city Blaming China and Chinese people during a global pandemic is deeply unoriginal As Nayan Shah argues in Contagious Divides Epidemics and Race in San Francisco s Chinatown the Honolulu fire was far from the only time in U S history that racism worsened a public health crisis victimizing minorities and harming the population as a whole We are living through such a moment now as President Donald Trump elects to prioritize xenophobia partisan politics and fearmongering over the public s health It isn t just Trump though The entire public discourse about the novel coronavirus has been shot through with anti Asian rhetoric Conservative commentators have floated the idea that COVID is a biothreat from China and have gleefully taken up Trump s moniker for it the Chinese virus while conservative politicians have blamed Chinese culture and diet for the disease But racialized discourse about the outbreak can be found on the left as well The liberal news site Vox for example published a video purporting to explain Why New Diseases Keep Appearing in China in which it posited that China is home to such outbreaks because people there consume wildlife as though plenty of Americans don t also hunt and eat game The video itself points out that live wildlife markets exist around the world meaning that public health concerns should be about such markets not just about Chinese markets The very premise of the video was already a flawed way to frame the issue with approximately one fifth of the world s population over billion human beings for evolving viruses and bacteria to attack it s unsurprising that diseases emerge from China It s crucial of course for epidemiologists and health policy planners to study what particular social and economic conditions generate disease and to make recommendations to remedy those conditions But framing the conversation especially in less technical publications as a question about why China adds more than its fair share of global disease unnecessarily moralizes the issue and smuggles in invidious assumptions about race and culture Assessing our government s myriad failures in response to COVID consequently requires both criticizing the racism that has consistently been the backbone of Trump s approach to governing while also recognizing that Trump is not alone indeed that there is a deep history of the United States responding to plague times with racist panic and blame The COVID pandemic therefore calls for a renewed commitment to building a racially and economically egalitarian welfare state That means both funding a robust federal government with the power to take action for the public good and strengthening and enforcing anti discrimination laws But it also calls for robust public dialogue and education about the need for a society that treats all of its members with equal concern and respect History is an invaluable guide as we work toward that end section separator Assessing our government s failures in response to COVID requires both criticizing Trump s racism and recognizing that he is not alone Blaming China and Chinese people during a global pandemic is deeply unoriginal During the cholera epidemic in New York City in for example the Board of Health asked the city s leading doctors to gather all information on the subject of the Oriental Cholera When the epidemic arrived in New York those New Yorkers who could afford to flee the city embarked on a mass exodus leaving the poor to suffer in cheap crowded living spaces that formed a perfect environment to transmit the disease Commentators quickly moralized the epidemic arguing as one put it that cholera was almost exclusively confined to the lower classes of intemperate dissolute and filthy people huddled together like swine Not everyone fortunately agreed A Quaker critic saw the outbreak as a reason to contest the inequality of an industrializing and urbanizing society Was man made for this he asked or is he not able to raise himself out of this unequal degraded state If not better to be a stone destitute of sensibility Anti Asian hostility intensified in the second half of the nineteenth century as the U S passed a suite of immigration laws that restricted and eventually banned Chinese immigration Cities and states on the West Coast employed a mix of statutes ordinances arbitrary policing social pressure and mob violence to exclude and oppress people of Chinese descent This racist rhetoric and policy continued well into the twentieth century with explicit racial restrictions built into immigration laws until and quotas on immigration from Asia until Set against the backdrop of this period Shah s Contagious Divides narrates many moments of anti Chinese panic during epidemics in the United States well beyond the Honolulu fire of The PHS tracked a bubonic plague outbreak in China in for example and Shah explains that U S public health authorities anticipated the arrival of plague from that point onward They predict ed that one of the Pacific Coast s Chinatowns would be the most likely site of the epidemic s first strike PHS officers based in China and in North American Chinatowns Shah writes feared that the filth and overcrowding that they believed was characteristic of all Chinese living environments incubated bubonic plague Driven by these racist stereotypes about China and Chinese immigrants San Francisco targeted its Chinese population repeatedly from to amid a series of bubonic plague scares The city locked down predominantly Chinese neighborhoods and sent in squads to inspect and fumigate houses it restricted travel by any Chinese persons who were not vaccinated and it attempted to forcibly vaccinate the Chinese population Vaccination at the time was still an infant science and it could be physically horrific Forcibly vaccinating the city s Chinese population would be in effect to use them as test subjects Meanwhile the selective shutdown of immigrant neighborhoods further concentrated all of the economic suffering caused by the epidemic on a subordinated racial minority The Chinese in San Francisco did push back with some success Street protests occasionally forced public health officials to lift the quarantine and massive public resistance led officials to abandon their plan of forced inoculation In Wong Wai v Williamson federal judge William Morrow enjoined local and federal health officials from enacting a plan to prevent Chinese persons from leaving the city unless they had submitted to vaccination This coercive vaccination regime Morrow explained was boldly directed against the Asiatic or Mongolian race as a class without regard to the previous condition habits exposure to disease or residence of the individual It therefore violated the Fourteenth Amendment Judge Morrow explained that although public health officials have sweeping police power during an epidemic police power being the name for the general authority of sovereign governments to legislate and regulate to protect public health and welfare that power however broad and extensive is not above the Constitution San Francisco locked down Chinese neighborhoods restricted travel and attempted to use the Chinese population to test an experimental vaccine Morrow s opinion cited the famous case of Ho Ah Kow v Nunan in which U S Supreme Court Justice Stephen Field temporarily sitting as a federal circuit judge in California struck down a San Francisco law that required all prisoners to cut their hair short Field found that the law was merely a pretext to force Chinese men to cut their queues long braids and he wrote that in our country hostile and discriminating legislation by a state against any class sect creed or nation is forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment Ho Ah Kow v Nunan remains a crucial precedent establishing that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment blocks states from discriminating under pretextual laws In the context of public health crises like the one we face today Judge Morrow s opinion in Wong Wai v Williamson should be a similarly important precedent for the proposition that even under the police power racial discrimination is barred by the Fourteenth Amendment Nevertheless although Justice Field struck down the queue law in Ho Ah Kow v Nunan he still took the opportunity in his opinion to expatiate on the inferiority of Chinese immigrants He called them a vast horde and he criticized their dissimilarity in physical characteristics in language manners and religion These differences he said would prevent the possibility of their assimilation with our people He therefore argued that Congress should ban Chinese immigration a point of view that was very much of a piece with the larger Chinese Exclusion movement in the period A similar tone of contempt might very well be detected in Judge Morrow s language in Wong Wai v Williamson as he paints in broad strokes about the Asiatic or Mongolian race Such biased language and ideology are insidious even when they appear in judicial decisions that protect racial minorities from discrimination by the state section separator The police powers of the state and federal governments of course are critical for fighting disease and protecting the people s welfare The trillion federal recovery bill passed in response to COVID is a classic use of the police power as are Medicare Medicaid the Affordable Care Act and anti poverty programs such as Social Security unemployment insurance and SNAP But the police power also remains a potential tool for discrimination a loaded gun waiting for the wrong hand to wield it Justice Field s suggestion to ban Chinese immigration leans on a paradigmatic instance of the police power border control as did Trump s declaration of a national emergency in order to build his border wall Congress the public and the courts all need to be vigilant to distinguish real emergencies that justify expansive police powers from ginned up emergencies that let the executive act in a state of exception free from external legal control The COVID crisis is political just as much as it is medical Unfortunately our government s use of police powers today is still frequently shaped by racial discrimination just as it was in the late nineteenth century Now as then militaristic combat metaphors are swirling together with anti Asian racism in government rhetoric As Trump has beefed up military funding under his isolationist xenophobic America First foreign policy he has slashed federal offices and agency funding devoted to foreign aid global health and disease preparedness He has undermined diplomacy and international cooperation which are essential in a global pandemic And he proposed cutting funding for the Centers for Disease Control CDC even as his Secretary of Health and Human Services refused to divert any funds from the border wall to cover potential CDC shortfalls These racist efforts to cut off public health funding to developing nations to keep out Hispanic immigrants and to means test and generally eviscerate the domestic welfare state are directly tied both ideologically and materially to the stripped down public health bureaucracy Trump has created through a toxic combination of malice and neglect a public health bureaucracy that now lacks the capacity and nimbleness to respond fully to the coronavirus pandemic and that leaves us all more vulnerable as a result The COVID crisis is political just as much as it is medical Our response to the twin crises of coronavirus and Trumpism has to be both medical and political as well Only by acting together collectively through government which is to say via democratic politics will we be able to fight off this disease and rebuild better in the aftermath Like the Quaker writer in New York in who saw the cholera epidemic as a reason to improve social and economic equality it s up to progressives today to demand a robust racially egalitarian welfare state that governs in the public interest plans ahead treats everyone with equal concern and respect and helps its people navigate medical catastrophe and economic collapse Then maybe next time we can escape the worst legacies of our past and confront the disaster effectively together

3012,3012,It s much easier to parse than you believe As transgender liberties are increasingly being threatened and battled for around the world trans a listers and activists that are LGBTQ challenging ordinary people to see intercourse and sex identification as two entities Exactly what is gender identification precisely and just how does it vary from the intercourse an individual is assigned at delivery Why aren t these terms interchangeable So what does it suggest to be male and just what does it suggest to be female Works out there s a fairly simple answer behind an usually complicated topic pictures of honduran mail order brides The essential difference between sex and gender > What exactly is sex assigned at delivery A sex to the child male or female in many cases when a baby is born a delivery doctor or midwife assigns This assigned intercourse is dependent on the real faculties that comprise a body that is person s their genitals their hormones and their secondary intercourse characteristics such as for example breasts to mention a few This really is then marked on a delivery certificate for the government s documents Most of the time intercourse project is conflated with one s sex identification But sex and intercourse are a couple of things that are completely different While intercourse is defined because of the real traits observed regarding the human anatomy sex is really an experience that is psychological And exactly how an individual identifies gender wise does not fit neatly into always the binary types of male and female Some individuals call the intercourse we re assigned at delivery biological sex But this term does not completely capture the complex biological anatomical and chromosomal variants that may occur Planned Parenthood describes Having just two choices biological male or biological feminine may not explain what s happening inside a person s human human human body What exactly is sex identification The gender inclusive advocacy company Gender Spectrum calls sex identification our profoundly held interior feeling of self as male female a mixture of both or neither This means that our gender is who we internally understand ourselves to be After that sex expression is how we present our gender into the global globe and exactly how culture tradition community and household perceive communicate with and attempt to contour our gender This occurs with regards to gender roles how you ought to dress act behave based on one s perceived gender identification READ CONSIDERABLY Sex identity is related closely having a person s perception of these human anatomy as someone may alter their appearance that is physical to or maintain their gender As an example you may be cisgender if the sex to your gender identity corresponds you had been assigned at delivery Transgender both women and men may take hormones replacement treatment to improve their body s physical functioning Cisgender men with removed testicles might take testosterone injections to steadfastly keep up their testosterone amounts and females with Kallmann problem might simply simply just take estrogen to start puberty While every and each of those circumstances may alter or maintain a person s physical look their sex identification continues to be intact regardless how their human body appears We become conscious of our sex identification in the long run No one comes into the world completely understanding their sex identification Gender as a thought is socialized through experience of people and sex roles and scientists will always be uncertain whenever small children start to understand the idea of sex identity Based on one research many kiddies have actually an operating familiarity with sex roles by to a couple of years including a feeling of awareness regarding one s gender that is own For a kid to build up a stable feeling of their sex identification it could use up to four years claims the United states Academy of Pediatrics Not everybody knows their sex at an age that is young however Numerous transgender individuals spend their youth and young adult lives uncertain of the gender identification Simply because trans folks are usually bombarded from an age that is early messages that equate intercourse with sex Because of this some trans individuals require years to comprehend their sex identification and begin transitioning Other people figure it down fairly young but nevertheless have trouble with support or acceptance from their own families In any event sex is hard to comprehend because our culture delivers a lot of signals that are mixed intercourse sex functions and gender phrase The very good news is the fact that many kids see sex as excessively versatile The discussion cites one study where to year olds were shown an image of two toddlers cross dressing a cisgender child in girls garments and a cisgender woman in boys clothes that are Participants thought the cisgender child had been a vice and girl versa The analysis implies that small children see sex as relatively fluid and therefore more rigid definitions of sex like those that gas transphobia are discovered as time passes and thus socialized ideas which can be changed or modification boffins remain finding out gender s causes There are many theories within the systematic community regarding gender identity s origins One research through the Scientific United states reveals that transgender people s minds work much like their cisgender counterparts This suggests that one s gender identity perhaps maybe not their intercourse assigned at delivery describes how a mind functions and functions Gender itself may be produced within the womb too As Jane Brody writes for the Sarasota Herald Tribune current reports unveil that a modification of the brain s intimate differentiation during maternity can result in a fetus creating a sex identification that differs from cisgender sex development Transgender brains that are women s as an example may develop as ladies even though the human body develops a penis and scrotum Meanwhile extra androgens may cause transgender males to build up their sex identity as males while their human body will continue to establish vagina and ovaries While researchers are nevertheless researching the reasons behind sex dysphoria the sensation that your particular sex doesn t suit your intercourse assigned at delivery transgender experiences will help paint a wider picture of human gender identification by explaining exactly exactly exactly how sex emerges exactly just how it exists individually from intercourse and exactly why you can find so people that are many try not to recognize with all the sex they certainly were assigned at delivery FIND OUT MORE Our comprehension of sex is evolving basically As trans activist and vlogger Riley Dennis describes talking about a trans girl as a female who s that is biologically male be harmful I would personally argue that intercourse has to have the change that is same sex has been through Dennis claims It s perhaps maybe not just a fixed reality It s a social construct This means you will find better terms to utilize whenever speaking about systems instead of male female and Trans and intersex activists give consideration to our present sex that is male female a simplification of nature ignoring the fact intercourse and sex can not be aligned therefore neatly according to two easy categories Alternatively these advocates genuinely believe that intercourse is really a social construct according to social and social some ideas of how a human body should look and just exactly how it ought to be gendered This will be especially clear in terms of intersex systems Based on the Intersex Society of the united states intersex is a phrase accustomed describe people born by having a reproductive or anatomy that is sexual doesn t appear to fit the normal definitions of feminine or male A scrotum formed like a labia or a mixture of XX and XY chromosomes for instance some intersex people are born with a large clitoris Sometimes intersex conditions appear at an age that is early in other cases they emerge during puberty But regardless intersex experiences declare that systems can not be rigidly defined into male and female categories Every person s human body is various Sex is not inherently gendered Sex is not something we re really created with it is a thing that physicians or our moms and dads assign us at birth Mey Rude writes for Autostraddle Neither chromosomes nor genitals are binary in the manner that biological sex defenders claim they ve been while the great majority of measures through which we judge intercourse are extremely much changeable Rather Rude implies that intercourse is not inherently gendered From a target viewpoint intercourse is in fact a group of biological responses that can cause specific characteristics such as for instance undesired facial hair or lean muscle mass to seem or vanish inside a body that is person s And because our definitions of intercourse are inconsistent and arbitrary which also means some one can alter sexes by changing their hormone amounts and genitalia There s nothing intrinsically male about XY chromosomes testosterone human body locks muscle tissue or penises Rude explains Sex like sex is definitely socially built and will be changed Therefore while sex it self is a proper experience that folks psychologically experience intercourse is essentially defined by social and social values and never always by objective systematic truth Therefore what is the brand new gender paradigm Trans acceptance remains an uphill battle Also among trans inclusive communities numerous still see cisgender sex identities as humanity s standard sex identities Many people usually do not wish to acknowledge that intercourse is socially defined sex functions are synthetic and our feeling of self is a far more crucial defining element than a health care provider peeking at a baby s personal components But as trans activists introduce an even more look that is neutral human being biology young Us citizens are challenging the direction they think of sex and intercourse It might take a while and never every person will comprehend straight away but asking questions regarding intercourse and sex identification may be the first rung on the ladder to a much bigger conversation on accepting trans intersex and gender nonconforming individuals identities as legitimate People want to begin learning in what intercourse is really and just just what social constructs really are Rude writes They have to stop biology that is misusing distributing lack of knowledge and misunderstanding People want to stop interested in excuses with regards to their anti trans bigotry All this has to stop also it has to stop now Editor s note this short article is frequently updated for relevance Ana Valens

10111,10111,Hi everyone I hope you are all managing to have a good day I didn t get on here this morning because we didn t wake up until o clock Shameful I was up in the night after a horrible nightmare though but went back to sleep so not really an excuse It s been a funny old day so far I had made a birthday card for someone and wanted to post it but as I am being shielded wasn t sure what to do Anyway we decided that we would do our daily walk but go into town and put said card in the central letter box By the way the card is one of a whole lot which come in a book sold by the NT You colour them in and the matching envelopes and add your own greeting Folding the envelope was a challenge but I got there in the end and I even had a stamp But I digress we walked into town and I posted the card hope it gets there and as expected Mr K couldn t resist going in to the shop to get a newspaper I was told to stay outside and keep away from people As others started to arrive I crossed over the road and had a look at the notice in the solicitor s window until Mr K joined me Just as he came up to me the window opened and the secretary asked if she could help us Result We still had not got the forms we needed notarising for YS s house sale because we couldn t work out how to do it safely The secretary brought the solicitor to the window and when we explained our predicament she asked us to bring the firms this afternoon and she would see what she could do All this through and open window We walked back home grabbed a bite of lunch collated all the documents passports photos etc plus cash for the fees and went back for a two o clock appointment We stood in front of the open window and the solicitor came down and took the forms etc and sent us back to sit in our car outside while she took all the documents and went through them She then waved to us and we went back and stood in front of the window and she passed us each document in turn to sign with our own pen and then she signed and witnessed them We then sat in the car again while she took them to be photocopied and when she waved to us we went back and collected them and paid her the cash It was amazing to finally get it sorted and all while social distancing We now just have to get them across to YS or his solicitor Post is not an option as we can t register them as our post office is firmly shut We will talk to YS tonight and see whether we drive them there or he collects them What a relief to get it sorted though so we don t hold up their exchange of contracts We came back and had a cuppa two choice biscuits each to celebrate The sad news is that we heard last night that an old work friend of Mr K s has lost his battle with cancer and his wife i in a care home with dementia A bit of a shock as they are our age We used to socialise with them quite a bit before he went to another company and then retired to France So sad My hair now almost has a ringlet down one side What is wrong with it for goodness sake When I was growing up I dreamed of having curly hair Why wait until now when I really don t Mr K continued his battle with the jackdaws and the bird table It s brought me endless amusement We have one of those bird tables which has four legs supporting a pitched slate roof all on top of a post When we first got it years ago the pigeons kept stealing all the food meant for the robins finches and tits so he put a batten rail round half way up the legs which stopped the pigeons nicely because they were too fat It was quite funny watching them sliding down the pitched roof trying to get back in until they conceded defeat However recently the jackdaws have been stealing the food instead Mr K got really cross so he put a bamboo rail round the bottom section half way up This worked to start with and it was really funny watching the jackdaws trying to get past it Think Hitchcock s The Birds There were dozens all sitting on the fence and trees taking it in turns to try and get in Really funny Mr K thought that he had won but then a couple of days later one jackdaw realised he could stand on the middle bar and duck his head in After that they all did it Mr K was so exasperated and I was hysterical with giggles He stormed out and nailed a bamboo rail round the top half So now little birds should be able to get in but the jackdaws definitely can t That wasn t the end though The other night I was sat here watching as the jackdaws gathered on the fence chattering to each other and then four of them all flew at the bird table one to each side and banged into it really hard completely rocking it and bird food fell out and then they had a party I think Mr K has given up Well enough of my rambling Hugs to all who need one Stay safe and stay well xx

Their niche in the MMO ecosystem is, quite frankly, that of the elk. The lions are PvPers who, when not fighting each other over territory, will also hunt them.

And of course, nobody likes being the grass, which is why that type of player rapidly kills off an MMO unless the developer builds a fence to keep the herbivores out, or the developer is very, very, very good about maintaining the right balance.

6079,6079,There s been a lot of articles on the Tara Reade sexual assault allegations against Joe Biden today Quite a few of em are crapola either treating Reade s allegations as the gospel truth or insisting that the whole thing is a nothingburger which should be ignored Neither take is correct or useful Reade does have some holes in her story and while I do not see any fingerprints of the Trump Administration on this yet they have proven that they will eagerly ratfuck Joe Biden and use the weight of the US Government to do it and that the Senate will not lift a finger So this needs to be addressed A few random points The story now has legs This is not all bad news as many have noted the New York Times investigated her story and said it was inconclusive Which is generally what you would expect in the case of a decades old sexual assault allegation if there s no physical evidence and no witnesses then it becomes a battle of dueling reputations But the story is receiving coverage now at major media outlets CNN has covered it quite a bit and while they are treating the allegations as allegations the fact that the story is going to press rather than being circular filed by editors as unsubstantiated gossip is a major change There is something to see here even if it s not what you think Even though I still support Biden as the nominee at this point those insisting that There Is Nothing To See Here are like Leslie Nielsen outside the burning fireworks factory in The Naked Gun There is something It might be actual sexual misconduct it might be ratfucking it might be something else But it is not nothing Much of the evidence is hearsay but does that matter One interesting issue is the various reports of associates of Reade confirming that she told them about the alleged assault Some media sources particularly hostile ones are treating this as damning as corroborating evidence Yes and no Were this matter to be tried in a court of law no testimony of the sort she told me it happened would be admissible as evidence it s all hearsay The witnesses in this case have no actual knowledge of whether the event happened or not only what they were told by someone else and the fact that A told B something is usually not relevant On the other hand this will not be tried in any legal proceeding the statute of limitations has long expired and unlike the situation with Brett Kavanaugh there are not any confirmation hearings in which testimony under oath will be solicited And such evidence can establish that this wasn t something that Reade thought up recently Trump s best shot is to bring Biden down to his level Right now Trum ps approval rating is in the hole by about points at the average about where it was prior to his brief covid bump Biden is leading in most swing state polls and within single digits in places like Texas And nearly of the population is in one of two camps with regard to Trump they either love him or they despise him Unfortunately for Trump the despises him camp is far larger Fortunately for Trump much of the despises him vote is sequestered in safe blue states and the swing states are more favorable for him though still breaking for Biden at this point Professional concern troll Damon Linker has an article on how this could swing the election back to Trump despite the fact that even were the allegations against Biden found to be true Trump is an order of magnitude worse If Biden can be dragged down to Hillary levels of unpopularity and large number of voters to stay home in disgust his eager base of racists and bitter enders might carry him to victory And rest assured he will not be stayed by concerns of hypocrisy I could even see Trump boasting of being a more accomplished p y grabber than Biden noting that the latter was allegedly rebuffed in his alleged attempt to seduce Reade Linker s column is full of the usual sanctimony and gosh my own side are twits too virtue signalling that have long made him the go to liberal for conservatives looking for evidence that their opponents are acting in bad faith and he assigns too much weight to some of the corroborating evidence see above but Trump wants this election to be a mudfight And if the Reade allegations come to dominate coverage of Biden much as email gate dominated coverage of Hillary Clinton he might get his wish Joe Biden will need at some point to address the allegations He through his campaign has issued a strongly worded denial of the allegations which is a good start Far better to do that than issue a non denial denial But at some point especially if the allegations become more specific he may need to answer questions like the following Where were you on the night in question Did you receive a duffelbag from Ms Reade If so Was there any sort of physical contact Any conversation In short either an alibi or a more specific and detailed refutation of the allegations At this point again this is not a judicial search for truth but a battle of credibility No judge is going to curate the evidence no jury is going to render a verdict A lot of opinions on the subject will be based on politics with both the Right and the far Left screaming guilty no matter what happens But there are a lot of voters in the middle who might be persuaded either way and a stronger defense argument than did not happen That said there are good reasons to be skeptical of Reade s allegations As many have said women who make allegations of this sort should have them investigated and not swept under the rug There are more than a few legit concerns with the allegations as currently set forth and dumpthechump s diary goes over them fairly well But we are now beyond the point where simply sweeping them under the rug is possible What is the contingency plan if the worst occurs This is a question that should be answerable even in the absence of allegations like this if Joe Biden were to pass away suddenly who would become the nominee Right now the party seems far more united behind him than they were behind Hillary four years ago and the faction seems mainly to consist of folks who ordinarily will not vote for Democrats but were something to happen what then Should Sanders who has the second most delegates or had before covid kiboshed the nominating process get it instead Are Biden s delegates released to vote for whoever they like And what about if something happens after the nomination is formally awarded does his running mate become the presidential nominee Is the party prepared to deal with ratfucking As noted in the lede we already have evidence that the Trump Administration is willing and able to abuse its authority to hamstring its presumptive opponent And rest assured the hats will support every bit of this thinking that the Totally Unfair And Tyrannical FBI investigation of Trump Russia in provides all the justification that is necessary After all Trump was impeached over the Burisma business and the GOP Senate signaled rather loudly that they no longer care about the sort of misconduct that essentially got Nixon driven from office nearly a half century ago I almost expect that this is merely the opening act and that at some point official investigations from a Senate committee or by the DOJ will be commenced on this topic or on something else Such investigations might have teeth or they might be merely launched so Biden s under investigation FUD can be floated in the media even if such investigations reveal nothing of substance At this point though to the extent that Reade s allegations are organized ratfucking it appears to be mainly coming from the political left from factions looking to sabotage Biden s path to the nomination rather than trying to cripple in him the general election Note I am NOT accusing the Sanders campaign of having anything to do with this Trump might benefit more from an October surprise than from one in April And the Trump Administration has a long history of being hamfisted fuckups who routinely step on their own dicks starting with Trump himself On the other hand we also know that Russian intelligence is likely to try to mess with the Democrats as they proved in they do NOT want Biden to win And unlike Trump they are competent and ruthless and I am certain that this time around our counter intelligence assets will be instructed to stand down by our corrupt attorney general This observation is largely CT at this point as there s no evidence of any such involvement but do expect it to happen Putin can see that his puppet is in some trouble domestically and the last thing he wants is a competent Democratic administration in Washington especially one that has now far more reasons to distrust Moscow than Obama ever did Comment Anchor Comments Tip Jar Should Sanders who has the second most delegates or had before covid kiboshed the nominating process get it instead I would keep in mind that Democrats were willing to get behind JOE BIDEN rather than vote Sanders as hard warning of how bad this idea would be especially as the Sanders camp involvement in spreading these claims is going to be blamed Running Sanders ow would be even worse than before and people were already running I do not think anything will come of this but the contingency should not be an already disliked candidate with multiple risk factors for dying in an ongoing pandemic if Joe Biden were to pass away suddenly who would become the nominee Sorry BOBs even if Biden was kidnapped by outer space aliens and flown away in their flying saucer tonight the nomination still would not go to Bernie It would mean a brokered convention with Biden s delegates free to pledge to any candidate they chose and few if any of Biden s delegates would choose Sanders Thank you Also talk of the nomination process has no business in a diary about this incident That makes it obviously a political concern not a genuine one The diary is a story of political concern Engineer makes it clear that the only evidence is hearsay What Engineer does not cover is that Reade skewered any credibility she might have That s basically why NYT and I forget whatever other mainstream media outlet kibosh ed the story Pulitzer winning reporters who worked Weinstein Reade only made a sexual assault allegation when Biden became presumptive nominee Plus she has a proven history of supporting Biden If these were both private citizens with no public profile it would not be looked at by any law enforcement nor be a story in any valid media Period This is pathetic political bullshit I am by no means trying to discredit any woman or man who has been harmed by sexual misbehavior of any person They do deserve to be heard However sometimes that being heard is by a good counselor or decent support group and not the world media during an election cycle Blasey Ford was credible and her story brought me to tears by triggering memories of sexual assaults I was witness to in my youth It rang true Reade does not make sense While we know such assaults do happen her story comes across as out of place Think of the timing the changes the lack of it fitting Biden indeed via her own public publishing Again she is not credible Yes I am for Biden but that would not interfere with my looking with an open mind as judges address jurors to do Fini Ronan Farrow took a pass What does that tell you My opinion is that for such case we have to keep open mind and be aware of the evidence And I think we have done this I have read the newspaper articles And then I think each one of us has to make our own decision Personally my opinion is that she is not credible I have to admit that my decision may be biased based on my political orientation but nevertheless that is my decision As noted this is not a legal or criminal matter that will be decided by the courts So I guess I feel that is a valid process and I am ready to move on Ok My short honest answer is Yes I am engaging in hypocrisy because I refuse to give this story a lot of thought The thoughts that I HAVE given it tend to be to seek reinforcement for reasons to distrust her story I have found plenty of that Furthermore my honest answer is that I am at peace with my hypocrisy I am not about to let the perfect become the enemy of the good In this case I can clearly see a value difference between Biden annd Trump and that is even if Ms Reade s allegations have some merit Republicans have FEASTED upon the willingness of Democrats to hold themselves to standards that Republicans themselves have abandoned Ask Senator Al Franken about that Given all of that and the importance of the Democratic party confronting Trumpism and stopping the alarming corrosion of necessary government institutions I can make the choice to accept the accusations of hypocrisy and live with them I can see the greater good By the way in my head I want to tell Fox Newsies that caterwaul about Democratic hypocrisy YOU took past behavior off the table when you backed Trump If you find it frustrating and even infuriating to have an opponent engage in hypocrisy then welcome to MY world Al Frank is instructive here though for another reason He survived the initial story the woman on the USO tour with the photo But then new revelations came out and they kept coming out Any one or even two or three wouldnt have done him in but at some point you have to stop the bleeding Right now that hasnt happened Thats both telling about whether its true these are almost enver one time incidents and how Biden should react ride it out Al Franken allowed a steady drip of bullshit stories to bully him into resigning when it was not necessary to do so If Dems actually allow Trump and the criminally enabling Republican party to sieze the moral high ground on the topic of sexual harrassment and assault then for fucks sake we deserve to lose I suspect Roger Stone and other Republican operatives watched the Franken dynamic or indeed probably orchestrated it and took careful notes filing them away until In my view it s reasonably likely we are now seeing their attempt to apply those lessons learned to Joe Biden And yes I know Stone is in prison They all deserve to be there I do not know Ms Reade from Ms Thatcher or Ms Doubtfire What I have read about her shifting claims does not engender trust but the timing is just far too convenient for Trump Far too convenient Joe Biden has been in the public eye for decades even for years in the White House as a very active and relied upon Vice President Not then No Even when it would embarrass that much hated African American in the Oval Office The time wasn t right I guess But now now the time apparently is right And I wonder why that is You are not being a hypocrite and read dumpthechump s liked diary if you have not along with the links it contains Even if the allegations are true and honestly it s a probabilities game at this point right now I am more on the side of disbelieving the allegations but I have gone back and forth it s not hypocritical to support someone who would basically be a good president with good judicial nominees over whatever clusterfuck disaster a second Trump term would bring I think we have seen the Democratic party take bad stuff seriously balanced with pragmatism Franken was forced to resign but only because he would be replaced with a safe Democrat Ralph Northam in Virginia retained his governorship even through all of the heartache about the blackface photos because Democrats knew at bottom what was at stake if they lost the Democratic governorship And now Virginia is practically the envy of the country reaping the benefits of their pragmatism I hope little comes of this but I doubt even Trump will get too near it He knows that the media conveniently did him a favor by looking the other way when the news about his serial sexual predation came out but he also knows that they can not very well report on Biden in this context without reporting on him too How is Biden supposed to answer where he was the night in question when Reade has not said where this occurred or when it occurred And that s an excellent question Unspecific allegations that deny the defense the ability to answer fully ought to be viewed with more skepticism than it happened on the night of March nd at PM outside Senator Biden s office Of course it would not be reasonable to expect Reade to know or remember the specific minute But knowing what the day was or even a possible range of days would permit an investigation of sorts to commence Not knowing this detail makes it hard Again in a court of law generic allegations of wrongdoing generally do not get very far the prosecution or plaintiff has to plead their case with at least some specifity and be prepared to justify holes or unknowns in their allegations Of course this will not be going to court not unless Reade sues Biden or Biden sues her for libel or slander which would raise the stakes by allowing both parties to depose the other under oath so judicial rules of evidence and pleading sufficiency do not apply But she does not know when it happened does not help her case Not just the night in question but she also does not know where this supposedly took place What is there to answer to if Reade has no idea about the when and where That is why this is not really blowing up into a scandal because in addition of a major credibility problem her many tweets and retweets Reade can not even tell us what day what time of day where this supposedly took place I am sorry but a traumatic event like that would burn itself into your memory where you can at least name the PLACE the building the bar the gym barrack shopping center warehouse Not naming the place is likely by design That way nobody can check whether the bar was open that day at all whether a security guard allowed access to who and kept a record of it etc I was assaulted like this when I was I am now I remember what I was wearing it s fuzzy due to being almost three decades ago but I still remember I remember it was during the day the sun was in my eyes I think it was morning almost afternoon I remember where I was in my backyard I remember my cousin was wearing a white t shirt with a design on it and jeans I do not remember why I was outside but I remember being confused as to why he did that I remember running to tell my mom I do not remember the time of year but it was warm The whole event took maybe thirty seconds I wasn t pushed against a wall just accosted in the yard wearing a dress But some memories are forever The place has I believe been specified she claims that she was asked to deliver a duffel bag to Biden s senate office and that the alleged assault happened there or outside in the hallway However I have not seen the time given with any greater specificity than spring of She did work for Senator Biden at that time and would have had access to the Senate building where his office was located not sure if it was the Capitol building itself or elsewhere Where were these allegations when Biden was being vetted for VP This story does not have anything except the smell of desperation The way Republicans hated Obama if this story had been around you bet it would have been brought out years ago This is an abuse of every single victim of sexual assault because if a woman can use the accusation of it for political reasons or any other ulterior motives it makes it easier to discount real charges of sexual misconduct and attack their credibility Another compelling question is where were they in This was after Tailhook Bob Packwood and Biden s controversial role in enabling Clarence Thomas confirmation It was as woke as DC was before I think the press would have jumped on a story about Biden assaulting her Conservatives would have wanted revenge for Packwood who was moderate but he was done in by fema nazis Reade had leverage That she did not use it is telling These paragraphs from today s USA Today shed some light Worth reading the whole thing Prosecutor takes her case apart point by point By this January Reade was all in for presidential candidate Bernie Sanders Her unwavering support was accompanied by an unbridled attack on Biden In an article on Medium Reade referred to Biden as the blue version of Trump Reade also pushed a Sanders Elizabeth Warren ticket while complaining that the Democratic National Committee was trying to shove Biden down Democrat voters throats Despite her effusive praise for Biden s efforts on behalf of women after pledging her support to Sanders Reade turned on Biden and contradicted all she said before She claimed that her decision to publicly accuse Biden of inappropriately touching her was due to the hypocrisy that Biden is supposed to be the champion of women s rights Reade s writings shed light on her political alliance with Sanders who has a long history of ties to Russia and whose stump speech is focused largely on his position that American inequality is due to a corporate autocracy But at a very minimum Reade s wild shifts in political ideology and her sexual infatuation with a brutal dictator of a foreign adversary raise questions about her emotional stability ‚ñ∫Suspect timing For years Reade did not publicly accuse Biden of sexually assaulting her But then Biden s string of March primary victories threw Sanders off his seemingly unstoppable path to the Democratic nomination On March as Sanders was pondering his political future Reade finally went public with her claim The confluence of Reade s support of Sanders distaste for the traditional American democracy epitomized by Biden and the timing of her allegation should give pause to even the most strident Biden critics I hate to put it this way but it really seems that she found god in Sanders and lost her mind after Super Tuesday and this is her lame retribution Why did not this come out between when Biden was VP The Republicans were itching to impeach and remove Obama and failing that Biden would have done just fine Why did not this come out earlier in the campaign when Biden was vulnerable Remember the creepy hair sniffing stuff came out early on Reade was one of those women then Why if her story about being raped is true did not she say it was rape then He d have been knocked out of the running at that time because a former VP accused of rape at the start of his campaign before the debates That s the shit the media just eats up Instead she waited until he d sewn up the nomination Just in time for the pandemic to Crest and overtake the airwaves We knew the pandemic was coming too the first cases were coming out about the same time as these claims If Ronan Farrow does not find these allegations credible neither do I I stand corrected on the initial timing of these allegations Apparently she reached out to Times Up in January Other pieces of the allegations came out during the impeachment hearing Which is also odd timing I heard about it last month I stand behind the rest of my comment Additionally I am a victim of the type of assault she claims She praised Biden publicly until I have hated my abuser my cousin since I was If I ever find out he s died I will throw a party I hate three people in this world two of them abused me and the other is Trump I understand many assault victims will praise their abuser but most of them either have professional reasons for doing so or have been in long term relationships with them Child abuse domestic violence victims I highly doubt acquaintance rape victims feel the need to perform praise often Reade left Biden s office a quarter century ago and so far as I can tell has not worked where there d be a personal or professional reason or benefit to praise him especially following when everyone sort of assumed he was done with politics and any power he had was basically gone Exactly She was a private citizen with no following or influence Why would anyone assume that her praise was anything but genuine According to USA Today earlier this month Reade filed a police report saying she was assaulted in without naming Biden in order to give herself safety from threats she has received So she files a report in about a assault but does not name Biden because she fears for her safety Yet she repeatedly names Biden as her rapist in press reports and interviews This makes no sense to me Why would NOT naming Biden in the police report give her any more safety from threats she alleges she s received prior to filing the police report Link to USA Today article Police reports IIRC are generally made under penalty of perjury She s willing to swear under oath that she was assaulted but not to identify who under those conditions Because she s ~lying~ Her rational for filing the police report never made sense to me and I am surprised a credible news publication did not picked up on it I assume they are too afraid that ll appear that they are bashing the victim It makes sense if you are Rich McHugh who broke the story and subsequently implied he s seen the real police report and in consort with Halper Robinson and Grim want a manufactured development to keep the story alive Filing a false police report is a felony right Which is why she did not mention Biden Has to be because she knows her assailant Not putting his name on there is incredibly telling I am not sure about this I think she did name Biden but the public record of the complaint does not name Biden or her Ronan Farrow looked at it and said there were problems and not enough there to further That s good enough for me We tried what you are suggesting in Hillary sat down for a full day of questioning on live TV It changed no one s mind Biden could do the same Answer every question live on TV It would not change anyone s mind On either side It would not change mine It would not change Krystal Ball s mind either Russian Manufactured propaganda All made up to smear Biden and same way the Russians made up the emails the uranium one and the Benghazi scandals to smear Hillary and help Stupid idiot keep the WH Do not fall for this Reade crap the same way the Russians made up the emails the uranium one and the Benghazi scandals to smear Hillary and help Stupid idiot get the WH This woman is not credible Changing her story which was a SoundCloud Backed up by Larry King interview Loves Biden supports Biden hates Biden loves Putin Please Krystal Ball lost it years ago and today comes across as a bitter person who mistakes snide remarks for intelligence I have no idea what happened to her She was decent in her msnbc days One aspect that is not mentioned is how in the hell could Biden hike up her skirt and get his hand inside her panties and penetrate her with a finger How long would that take And she has to have at least one arm free and close enough to bite his damn nose off She also would have been wearing pantyhose under her skirt Which would make penetration all but impossible Yep I remember Pencil skirts and panty hose Women over a certain age I am will think it s physically impossible I do Seriously You want his defense to boil down to the level of difficulty and whether or not she was wearing pantyhose It would in a court of law bUt hE iS not oN TrIaL I know I know That s not the point the point is she s not credible and here s a whole list of reasons why she is not credible from women who know what we are talking about Reasons that will not be covered in the media but that every woman of a certain age knows It s called a discussion between peers I believe it s a problem for the people reporting it It s destroying whatever credibility they had left I do not know who took Willy Wonka Nathan J Robinson seriously before but I hope they reconsider after all the stuff coming out of him coaching the witnesses deleting tweets protecting Tara from less than friendly news outlets If Biden goes down I want Andrew Cuomo as the candidate Here we go LOL He is not Biden will be the nominee And that s a good thing The only thing this does in my mind is give disenchanted Republicans an excuse to stick with Trump And Bernie stans an out Well there goes We are fucked I hope the Dems and Biden address this ASAP rather than remaining silent Otherwise Looks like trump is going to easily win again even with mass unemployment and peeps dying of COVID Our country is so jacked up Calm down This needs dealing with not surrender That dirty tricks would be employed was to be expected Biden and Dems better deal with this shit way better than Hillary did with the server or say goodbye to and our country jameskirk and EngineerScotty both joined in Coincidence There are no coincidences Were this matter to be tried in a court of law no testimony of the sort she told me it happened would be admissible as evidence it s all hearsay I am not sure it would necessarily be inadmissible Some lawyer can correct me but admissibility of hearsay evidence can depend on other factors such as in this case whether Biden would be available for cross examination or if you are not actually using the hearsay to prove Biden did it but rather to show that Reade said X Y and Z at a certain time Anyway I am am less spooked by this than many seem to be For one thing there s no way that Trump himself or I d argue the GOP qua GOP can use this allegation because it just brings to mind Hey have not plus women accused Trump of sexual assault If the women who accused Trump are all liars why is not this woman lying too Or if this woman is telling the truth does not that mean the women who accused Trump are telling the truth Trump and the GOP do not want to go there From what I have seen the GOP right wing are mostly using this to paint Democrats with some justification as hypocrites citing the Kavanaugh accusations And while I am sure the right wing blogosphere and diehard Bernie bros will continue to try to flog this story just as they will the Biden has dementia story absent some serious new evidence it just will not go far and will burn out just as the outrage over Trump s pussy remarks did This story would have had more legs if it had surfaced in October I do think Biden should address it himself He should take advantage of interviews he has coming up to get the question asked and answer it He does not need to elaborate much All he really needs to say is I believe women s accusations need to be taken seriously and investigated by the press The evidence should be weighed and a judgment made All I can tell you is this did not happen He should ask that inquirers consider his years in public life and his reputation and the testimony of staff who have worked for him and contrast them with Reade s allegations He should not speculate on Reade s motives Period finito Well we will get his answer soon enough I can almost guarantee you that he will be asked in the next interview and how he handles it may just be the most important part of the whole election We may be fine But if it goes badly Say hello to a second term So how many more of these Let us Smear Joe Biden Maybe Bernie Sanders Will Magically Become President In Spite Of The Fact Nobody Wants Him diaries do we still have to suffer through today Rest assured I am not trying to sabotage Biden and score the nomination for Bern Though I understand your frustration there is a subset of Sanders supporters out there who would rather have Trump than a Democrat Not Named Bernie and many of them are eagerly pushing this story My initial reaction is that Reade has a credibility gap but the Biden campaign does not inspire confidence by citing NYT as having debunked it only to get immediately slapped down by NYT for putting words in their mouth He could tell University of Delaware to give press access to his Senate records that they claimed would take years to process years ago it s certainly not helping to slow walk that right now After the alleged assault Reade said she complained about Biden s harassment to Marianne Baker Biden s executive assistant as well as to top aides Dennis Toner and Ted Kaufman All three Biden staffers recently told The New York Times that she made no complaint to them And they did not offer the standard noncommittal I do not remember any such complaint The denials were firm She did not come to me If she had I would have remembered her Kaufman said Toner made a similar statement And from Baker I never once witnessed or heard of or received any reports of inappropriate conduct by Biden period Baker said such a complaint had Reade made it would have left a searing impression on me as a woman professional and as a manager I appreciate the clarity of this diary Getting our candidate fully vetted NOW which means looking at all the angles is to our advantage so it does not regain traction during the general election

2967,2967,Comment Anchor Comments Tip Jar If someone takes this and dies because they read it here their blood is on your hands I do not feel like a lot of stupid people are reading this just sayin And I would also hope no one would take any more than standard dosage One of the medical guys said they have work to do on determining the covid treatment dosage Are you sure An awful a lot of people have not bothered to do a lick of research or hit the links They have just jumped on the band wagon and trashed the diary In the Australian article it said it s already FDA approved I admire Evel Knievel but if I post a link to a story about him and someone dies on a motorcycle I am pretty sure it s not my fault I am pretty clear in the declaration it shows promise as are the articles It s will amaze you just how ruthless I can be about posting links I might just post a link about how the U S is in gun suicides and I will feel no pangs of conscience Dwahahahaha Please take it down I have heard that if you run covid19 through a rock crushing machine it will kill the virus s Approved for use against parasites probably not approved for anti viral use They are working on that Hit the links It s antiviral activity has only been demonstrated in vitro It is not FDA approved as an antiviral If you do not know the difference do not write a diary about it Never the less this drug Ivermectin is already used orally for other diseases Did you look that up Are you going to I agree I vividly recall a case years ago in the ER where I worked when a young child was brought in having seizures her mother had administered the lice treatment orally instead of putting it on the child s hair scalp Ok and how is this different Did you look it up Are you going to Do your research Do just a tiny bit of research OK Just a tiny bit Search Ivermectin Go on STFU with your do your research schtick The research so far is that Ivermectin kills coronavirus in vitro That s it There is not any research to be done beyond that So do many many other compounds Do you have any idea how many compounds show promise in vitro but fail to do so in vivo in humans There s some research you can do I am not I heard wacko Trump encouraging people to take it and I heard the medical professionals telling people to wait until they have some evidence that it s useful and safe I also know one person already died from taking the wrong thing with a similar name I also know that people who have been prescribed the drug for approved reasons are finding it hard to get because of Trump s pimping it as a possible treatment Trump cult wackos like their leader are not the brightest bulbs on the tree That a gullible fool needlessly took his own life must not stop intelligent discussion of potential treatments Also I do not think they read Dkos Stop this That s out of line This is CT level stuff like what Trump s been sharing in his daily rallies Until potential treatments are proven safe and effective posting things like this does more harm than good This is not a conspricy fantasy Do the research I trust scientists and medical experts to do the research Until then claiming it works without evidence is unproven CT I appreciate the idea that you would want to find any glimmer of hope but this diary needs to come down These drugs do not work the same way on humans as they do in a petri dish When I hear it from Anthony Fauci I will believe it Til then wash your hands do not touch your face and wait it out until a vaccine is released And yes stupid people are everywhere Why the White House is full of them No it does not You need to do some research It is up to the diarist to post links to actual research Please do likewise or hold your peace you are a rando on the internet spreading bad information about a pandemic Wow so are a bunch of news outlets Please immediately call Monash University and let them know that commenters on daily kos disapprove of their work You are not a useful source of actionable information for surviving a pandemic YOU Y O U are the opposite of that You love that word It s an insult and flaggable Can not someone flag this diary I just reced it to unflagged it There s nothing wrong with it It s not a conspricy fantasy Sharkmeister Sharkman s protocol No I am Gabe the killer chess shark In chess circles a weak player is called a fish I am a really big fish We do not need snake oil salesman around here Take it down Please please please delete this We do not need any more idiots poisoning themselves Ivermectin is widely used in humans and livestock It has been revolutionary in treating various parasitic diseases in humans primarily in the tropics and has been instrumental in almost eliminating river blindness in some countries It s cheap effective at low dose micrograms kg and broad spectrum It s used widely in pets and livestock as an antiparasite drug As far as I can tell it has not been used as an antiviral in either humans or pets livestock It has shown some activity in vitro cultured cells in a petri dish against viruses but not in clinical trials However it s unlikely to kill anyone unless they ignore the dose requirements There is a mutation in dogs mdr that makes them sensitive to ivermectin but no evidence that it exists as a serious mutation in the human population As with all drugs they should not be taken without consulting a physician or pharmacist especially if you are on other medications Medication related interactions are the cause of the majority of ivermectin side effects It s also counter productive to tout these early studies here or in the popular press There are millions of compounds out there that will kill the COVID virus in the petri dish If that were a good measure of efficacy we d have cured all cancer decades ago There s a reason why drugs go through controlled clinical trials First you need to make sure they do not poison people Then you make sure they are as good or better than other treatments Then you see if they are effective in a broader trials THEN you can publish in the popular press Ivermectin has killed numerous horses for years Yes it s effective against almost all types of worms but it is not recommended for equines under year of age and is also responsible for the deaths of many senior equines as well And saved the lives of hundreds of thousands Penicillin has killed numerous humans Insulin has killed numerous humans Vaccines have killed numerous humans etc They have all also saved tens of millions No medication is safe It s why we do clinical trials Sources I have never heard of that and I have used ivermectin on horses since it first came on the market as an injection only prescription There was a problem with that it killed all the parasites so quickly that the horse could not process all the dead bodies and sometimes colicked I gave my first horse ivermectin till the year he died at It s actually used to treat acne rosacea Reduces Demodex numbers on the skin I am so stupid I thought many people would be happy that there s HOPE for a treatment method that could save millions of lives Here please hate me some more Hey MSN maybe it s part of Bill s depopulation program You are not introducing hope you are introducing ignorance Soap kills the virus too but that does not mean that we can use soap to treat someone who s infected There is a giant difference between a substance killing the virus in direct contact and a drug treatment killing the virus once it s inside a person s body while being safe for the person to take What is up with all the ninnies The diarist is posting links to news articles from established news outlets If you do not like that cover your eyes Or complain to the newspapers that published these stories Thanks I am just stunned by the hate I got for posting some hopeful news it s often difficult to predict how a diary will go over here but i do not think you deserve to get hammered like this PS as PROOF that this is a conspiracy theory here s an article in Antiviral Ressearch The FDA approved Drug Ivermectin inhibits the replication of SARS CoV in vitro Text from the article Highlights Ivermectin is an inhibitor of the COVID causative virus SARS CoV in vitro A single treatment able to effect ‚àº fold reduction in virus at h in cell culture Ivermectin is FDA approved for parasitic infections and therefore has a potential for repurposing Ivermectin is widely available due to its inclusion on the WHO model list of essential medicines Do you even know what in vitro means In vitro is not in vivo A world of difference there Links and a sensationalistic headline without any real context is pretty worthless Here s some context followed by a link Ivermectin has an established safety profile for human use and is FDA approved for a number of parasitic infections Importantly recent reviews and meta analysis indicate that high dose ivermectin has comparable safety as the standard low dose treatment although there is not enough evidence to make conclusions about the safety profile in pregnancy The critical next step in further evaluation for possible benefit in COVID patients will be to examine a multiple addition dosing regimen that mimics the current approved usage of ivermectin in humans As noted ivermectin was the focus of a recent phase III clinical trial in dengue patients in Thailand in which a single daily dose was found to be safe but did not produce any clinical benefit However the investigators noted that an improved dosing regimen might be developed based on pharmacokinetic data Although DENV is clearly very different to SARS CoV this trial design should inform future work going forward Altogether the current report combined with a known safety profile demonstrates that ivermectin is worthy of further consideration as a possible SARS CoV antiviral Welp The bolds get the essential data across Honestly do you really think the phrase shows promise is sensationalist Is not shows promise similar to the language in the published scientific paper I think when you just post links without context you are bound to get pushback from people Your headline is meaningless Shows promise is meaningless Worthy of further consideration is accurate People are scared Fear makes people stupid Yes there should be more context in the diary When I see that I do research There are a few long time dKos citizens that want everything fed to them on a silver spoon Which by the way do not do silver is poisonous Sigh of exasperation It needs to be edited It was nice of you to help That s a great deal more than anyone else commenting has done Let us sum up One Murdoch owned TV station in Australia a London tabloid ect Not really trustworthy news here in Murica until Faux Fiends share it I am not holding my breath This is one study and a very preliminary one at that They have no idea whether this actually works in vivo at all and there is a note even in these laudatory stories which all have virtually the same text which tells you that they all come from the same press release not actual reporting that they do not yet know if it works in a dose that s safe for humans The stories all note that ivermectin has also known to eliminate influenza dengue and HIV in vitro but you do not see it being used for treatment of any of those viruses either That s because the concentration necessary for that effect in vitro is very high i e dangerous and can not actually be used as a treatment I have read the Antiviral Research paper and I can tell you that this is in fact what it implies A very telling line referring to the only human trials that have been done on ivermectin s anti viral effectiveness against dengue in a trial in Thailand using a human approved dosage tells the story As noted ivermectin was the focus of a recent phase III clinical trial in dengue patients in Thailand in which a single daily dose was found to be safe but did not produce any clinical benefit emphasis mine Please delete this diary You are spreading the kind of rumor that gets people killed when they take high doses of unauthorized medication trying to cure themselves when there s no proof that it will actually work Do not be that person I hit recommend on your comment because some of us here have posted useful info that fills in the blanks created by the poster In fact you and I highlighted the most important line in the article I disagree however that the diary should come down mainly because of the useful comments within Did anyone trashing this diary hit the links or do a search on Ivermectin or did you just jump on the band wagon Is anyone going to do some research now that you have read that you should Also if someone wants to write a better diary about this please feel free I am still hopeful that soon human trials might start saving people s lives You can edit your diary to include context Maybe use the H button to make shows promise really big People are scared Fear makes people stupid It seems like some people here on trashing every ray of hope but then turning around ans spewing whatever crap came out of s face anus I am really disappointed with the level of willful ignorance being displayed in the comments This is not the way dKos normally is People here usally looks things up Other things which will kill off SARS CoV in vitro a blowtorch nitric acid lethal doses of ionizing radiation You should try looking things up as well take a look at all the breathlessly announced news releases in the last oh years on any topic announcing a new breakthrough on pretty much anything and then figure out how many of those actually resulted in something that worked in real world conditions soon after the widely publicized news release It s pointless When it s in the main stream press you will no doubt forget all about this It seems like some people here on trashing every ray of hope but then turning around ans spewing whatever crap came out of s face anus Bullshit The ones pushing diaries about preliminary extremely preliminary results regarding treatments and vaccines are doing exactly what Trump is doing Piss off Yeah you go ahead and do Remember to apologize when you hear about it on the TV Newsweek ANTI PARASITE DRUG USED SINCE S MAY HELP STOP CORONAVIRUS NEW STUDY SAYS This diary s pushing ivermectin sounds too much like Trump even still today pushing hydroxychloroquin second video a possibility And I say it what do you have to lose I will say it again what do you have to lose Take it I really think they should take it But it s their choice and it s their doctor s choice or the doctors in the hospital But hydroxychloroquin Try it if you d like But it is NOT Trump it s a team of educated professionals who have published a paper on their work The promise is in in vitro testing We also know that soap destroys COVID This is a pre clinical finding but the drug would have to go through Phase I II and III human testing before being approved Maybe there is some promise but it is very early Ivermectin has been used for decades to worm horses and dogs did not realize they used it for head lice on people too Here s hoping it or something works on Covid Possible coronavirus drug identified Ivermectin stops SARS CoV virus growing in cell culture Summary A new study has shown that an anti parasitic drug already available around the world can kill the virus within hours Scientists found that a single dose of the drug Ivermectin could stop the SARS CoV virus growing in cell culture The next steps are to determine the correct human dosage ensuring the doses shown to effectively treat the virus in vitro are safe for humans They are not going to listen to you They are gatekeeping because they are frightened It does not matter that Monash U is probably the finest research university in Australia I got flamed two months ago for stating this virus would be a problem would cause widespread economic misery as well as deaths You never claimed this was a cure as I saw one commenter say about it and you They are inflamed with righteousness Do you need an example Up until today there were people screaming that wearing masks is not effective and you are killing people spit flying from their lips Now everyone should wear them Like the rest of the world has for years If it does work you can bet the nanosecond the news breaks one of these jokers will publish a diary about it It s a little sad because I regard the KEY difference between Democrats and Republicans that Dems are about COMPASSION this kind of hostility is very Republican Diarist could have saved a lot of trouble by warning everyone to not take it for covid until it is approved and to make sure to consult a reputable doctor before doing so If you are audience is MAGA bubbas maybe so I do not know any reasonable persons that take prescription medications without both medical supervision and a legal prescription from an established practicing M D That said I do take a lot of supplements and have read encouraging things about melatonin quercetin and chaga mushrooms as having anti covid benefits If you look on the web you will find supportive info These are supplements that have been around for years and also offer diverse health benefits not related to covid

8002,8002,"If this how things are going to be moving forward, I feel like we all need bodycams, much like dashcams, recording every interaction in our lives just for records sake in case god forbid someone down the line misconstrued our intentions and found it creepy but couldn't be arsed to say something at the time. Intersex interactions are already hard enough as it is in this day and age of social media and technology. As just a regular guy, who's social and sexual cues are average at best, I wish more women would just be more honest and straightforward when it comes to how they feel about us males and their intentions. We can't all read women's minds. The man offered her wine and cheese towards the end of their show's production and she accepted his invitation. Why accept it if it made her feel uncomfortable? Or was it simply that the day after, she thought about it and began feeling uncomfortable because she accepted it? On top of that, he even apologised for inviting her in for wine and cheese, even though he had mentioned it beforehand that he's done the same with other production staff, and after she accepted his apology she offered him a hug. Would you really offer someone a hug if you felt that person made you uncomfortable? The movement was something powerful and helped those without a voice but I'm getting really tired of the women that have used it for their own illicit and untruthful gains and dragging the movement through the mud."
5897,5897,Everything is different this year yet God changes not I will prepare daily scripture readings for the days of Holy Week With my wife Rev Kazy Hinds we will prepare video services for Maundy Thursday and Good Friday These will be simple services for you to follow at home On Maundy Thursday we will offer a practice of hand washing that you may follow to commemorate the Last Supper in which the scriptures tell us our Lord washed the feet of his disciples Scripture readings for Monday of Holy Week Old Testament Isaiah Here is my servant whom I uphold my chosen in whom my soul delights I have put my spirit upon him he will bring forth justice to the nations He will not cry or lift up his voice or make it heard in the street a bruised reed he will not break and a dimly burning wick he will not quench he will faithfully bring forth justice He will not grow faint or be crushed until he has established justice in the earth and the coastlands wait for his teaching Thus says God the LORD who created the heavens and stretched them out who spread out the earth and what comes from it who gives breath to the people upon it and spirit to those who walk in it I am the LORD I have called you in righteousness I have taken you by the hand and kept you I have given you as a covenant to the people a light to the nations to open the eyes that are blind to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon from the prison those who sit in darkness I am the LORD that is my name my glory I give to no other nor my praise to idols See the former things have come to pass and new things I now declare before they spring forth I tell you of them Psalm Your steadfast love O LORD extends to the heavens your faithfulness to the clouds Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains your judgments are like the great deep you save humans and animals alike O LORD How precious is your steadfast love O God All people may take refuge in the shadow of your wings They feast on the abundance of your house and you give them drink from the river of your delights For with you is the fountain of life in your light we see light O continue your steadfast love to those who know you and your salvation to the upright of heart Do not let the foot of the arrogant tread on me or the hand of the wicked drive me away Epistle Hebrews But when Christ came as a high priest of the good things that have come then through the greater and perfect tent not made with hands that is not of this creation he entered once for all into the Holy Place not with the blood of goats and calves but with his own blood thus obtaining eternal redemption For if the blood of goats and bulls with the sprinkling of the ashes of a heifer sanctifies those who have been defiled so that their flesh is purified how much more will the blood of Christ who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God purify our conscience from dead works to worship the living God For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance because a death has occurred that redeems them from the transgressions under the first covenant Gospel John Six days before the Passover Jesus came to Bethany the home of Lazarus whom he had raised from the dead There they gave a dinner for him Martha served and Lazarus was one of those at the table with him Mary took a pound of costly perfume made of pure nard anointed Jesus feet and wiped them with her hair The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume But Judas Iscariot one of his disciples the one who was about to betray him said Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor He said this not because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief he kept the common purse and used to steal what was put into it Jesus said Leave her alone She bought it so that she might keep it for the day of my burial You always have the poor with you but you do not always have me When the great crowd of the Jews learned that he was there they came not only because of Jesus but also to see Lazarus whom he had raised from the dead So the chief priests planned to put Lazarus to death as well since it was on account of him that many of the Jews were deserting and were believing in Jesus If you would like to follow the Office of Morning and Evening Prayers This link will take you to the Mission of St Clare a resource following the Daily Prayer service in the Episcopal Church The link will open a page with all of the resources offered

together We stay at home to contain the virus for the sake of ourselves and our neighbors In the Palm Sunday sermon I suggested that we are in a season of lament which is not to say we are without hope Yet the solemnity of Holy Week especially in the isolation we find in provides a particular opportunity for us to reflect on our reliance on God even when we do not presently have every explanation As witnesses to and agents of God s steadfast love we are challenged to find new ways of being the church when we cannot get inside the building As we are practicing social distancing what new ways can we find to extend love hospitality and comfort to the ones we love and even the ones we do not know

8161,8161,Unlike Joule Murex was a lot less eager to get started As soon as the Shellder looked over the horizon and saw Lord Beerus looking back at him she let out an alarmed squeak and dove for the sands Her tongue spun like the rotor of a plane sending sand flying in every direction When Lord Beerus had faced off against Joule the controlled digging of the Dedenne allowed her to easily tunnel under the sand to play a trick on him Murex who had all the control of a drunkard and way less of a plan in mind did little more than wiggle herself into a big obvious looking crater Nevertheless she settled once she had dug about six feet into the sand sighing in relief This lasted for about three seconds before Lord Beerus walked to the edge of the crater narrowing his eyes in irritation He looked down at the Shellder sending a shimmering force rippling underneath the Shellder s body His tail swished from side to side then lashed out as he send the Confusion pushing upwards Murex would be joining the rest of the group topside any second now Except she had not moved Lord Beerus let out a huff then slid down the sandy crater to try and see what had happened There he saw Murex shell clamped tightly against a desert scrub She had completely engulfed the little plant and the same thin flexible branches and elaborate root networks that let it withstand the desert winds were now letting it survive the pull from Murex s shell and Lord Beerus telekinetic abilities Lord Beerus rasped as he realized what was going on laughing a little under his breath It was a clever technique true but cleverness for the sake of shirking training simply wasn t acceptable Now that he was at point blank range Lord Beerus settled into a focused stance eyes and gem glowing brightly once again This time the Confusion had to do the trick right The answer was still no While Murex visibly moved and the shrub swayed back and forth as if it were stuck in a wind tunnel no amount of telekinetic force was getting Murex s grip to slacken Even as sweat started to gather at Lord Beerus brow and his paws started to sink into the dirt the ever increasing psychic force did little more than leave the Shellder wiggling At this point it wasn t even a question of starting this training It was about Lord Beerus pride being set on the line He could ve snipped the shrub with a psychic cut at any point but that would be admitting defeat If he could not do it with his psychic power now then he d simply keep trying until one of them tired Elliot looked over the lip of the crater Echo and Joule joining him shortly thereafter Do do you think we should do something Elliot asked Echo gave him a blank look in return then shrugged Joule simply watched trying to hide the amusement in her little smile If only they knew what they had just signed up for Hours later Lord Beerus was practically flopped over into the desert stands tail thrashing furiously from side to side Occasionally he looked up eyes glowing a pure white before another Confusion yanked at Murex When it failed to work he simply flopped back down into the desert sands Joule slid down the crater pouring a bottle of water into a small bowl that was set down next to him He turned to it took a few lips then tried another fruitless effort Sighing Joule tossed the bottle out of the crater Echo catching it with a Confusion of her own and dropping it into a plastic bag Elliot was holding Elliot looked down at the bag then glanced up with a puzzled look on his face That s five so far He s really not gonna quit at this huh Elliot asked Lord Beerus looked back over his shoulder slurring out a few dizzy barks He then turned back to try again this latest blast of psychic power actually separating Murex from the shrub Elliot dropped the bag in surprise scrambling to the lip of the crater to see what was going on Echo waved a tiny flag with a poorly drawn picture of Lord Beerus face on it Joule simply leaned back a content and somewhat proud grin on her face Lord Beerus himself immediately perked back up ears pointing to the sky and tail on alert He let out a delighted almost over the top laugh eyes closing in relief Then Murex s tongue shot out from her shell wrapping right back around the shrub The excited chatter from the rest of the team fell silent with the exception of Lord Beerus He just clutched his head with his forepaws sinking down and groaning Echo paused then put down the tiny Lord Beerus flag to instead wave an equally tiny equally poorly drawn Murex flag Joule walked over to him gently fussing with his hair as he faceplanted into the sand Elliot headed over to Murex instead putting a gentle hand on Murex s shell I think you won this round Elliot said trying to keep himself from snickering too much But c mon Lord Beerus was just trying to help you know I know he can be a bit scary And a bit rude And sometimes he can be really harsh Another torrent of sand splashed against Elliot s back Lord Beerus slurring something incomprehensible into the ground But I promise he means the best for us So what do you say We have a snack break then give him a chance The words snack break were the first thing out of Elliot s mouth that Lord Beerus had not completely hated He hopped out of the crater Joule grabbing onto his tail to follow him out Murex released her hold on the branch and flopped into Elliot s arms sighing in relief as Elliot got them out of the crater Echo had already turned Elliot s backpack over shaking out all manner of snack foods and ingredients that he had packed for the trip It was time to feast + =

1596,1596,Looking for the original Non Doomsday Prepping series Start here Non Doomsday Prepping The Case for Being Prepared I would say there is a crisis a brewing but the crisis is that NOTHING is a brewing The world is out of YEAST You wouldn t think that some tiny microorganisms would matter so much to the mental well being of humanity but we re talking about yeast here the foundation of the staff of life which as everyone who isn t on the keto diet knows is totally bread No yeast no bread No bread no sandwiches No sandwiches no American Sandwich Project and THAT we cannot have But I have some good news You can make bread without having yeast I know it sounds crazy but it s true Not just yummy sweet dessert breads like banana and zucchini bread either You can have bread to make a sandwich on bread to go with a pot of soup bread to throw a couple eggs on top of for an easy breakfast No yeast required c is cup t is teaspoon and T is tablespoon Drop BiscuitsThe easiest no yeast bread of them all is the humble Drop Biscuit While you can make Drop Biscuits from pancake mix they are terrible because they taste like pancakes only grosser Making them from scratch is only just barely more work c flour T baking powder stick of butter OR T butter T lard OR ¬Ω cup Crisco ¬Ω t salt you might want to use a smidge more salt if using buttermilk more like ¬æ t ¬æ c milk OR ¬æ c buttermilk OR ¬Ω c milk and a whole egg this makes a richer dessert y biscuit suitable for strawberry shortcakes or for cobbler You want these liquid ingredients to be very cold Don t pour them in advance and leave them out on the counter Optional T sugar if you re making shortcakes or cobbler Put all your dry ingredients into a big bowl and give em a mix If you have a pastry cutter you can use it to cut into the dry ingredients including the sugar if you re making a dessert biscuit Others will say to use two knives but these people are masochists It s quite a challenge to chop up a stick of cold butter in a bowl of flour without making a mess even if you chunk up the butter first I do not have a pastry cutter for some inexplicable reason so I have a different method About an hour before you want to make biscuits put your cheese grater the bowl you want to grate into and your butter into the freezer After your components have gotten very cold take them out and quickly grate the butter into little pieces put them back in the freezer for a minute or two after or even during grating if they re melting badly Then once your butter is grated proceed with making your biscuits Even if the butter shreds stick together a little bit and they will they re still much easier to cut in with a sturdy fork You can t do this with shortening or lard but they re easier to cut in with a fork anyway Anyhoo cut your fat till the mixture resembles cornmeal Then add your milk or your egg and milk if going that route and stir till JUST combined Don t work out your aggression on that biscuit dough it ruins the texture It will look lumpy and doughy and that s ok I look lumpy and doughy too probably because I ate too many drop biscuits Body acceptance FTW Bake on a cookie sheet some say grease it some say don t I don t usually but I can see the benefit at degrees Some say or even but I am absentminded and lack an oven timer so I prefer a cooler oven Bake for about minutes but start checking them at about minutes to be sure you don t overcook them By the way it is said you can make this dough in advance and leave it in your fridge overnight to cook the next day I have some concerns about this scheme especially if you re using buttermilk because I fear the chemical reaction that allows the biscuits to rise might have run its course by then leading to underwhelming biscuits So make ahead if you want let me know how it goes but don t say I didn t warn you Once cooked these don t exactly improve with age Eat em fast Note about buttermilk you can make faux buttermilk by combining ALMOST the whole amount of milk with a small amount of lemon juice vinegar cream of tartar lemon juice I find gives the most authentic buttermilk y flavor Use about T lemon juice or vinegar per cup of milk or ¬Ω t cream of tartar per and let stand minutes before using Just remember your wet ingredients need to be COLD so don t forget that and leave your fake buttermilk sitting out on the counter While you can technically use these for dumplings I prefer my dumpling recipe that uses oil because it s much less work and the finished product is more tender Cooking them in boiling soup makes up for any lack of flavor that might come from not using butter You can find that here Broth and Stock Truly Making Something From Nothing Once you know how to make these simple little drop biscuits you can do all kinds of things For instance Good Old Fashioned Rolled BiscuitsUse the exact same recipe and mixing method suggested for drop biscuits but once the dough has gotten to the lumpy stage on a lightly floured surface roll or pat them out Don t fondle them there Biden you want to handle the dough as little as possible After you ve gotten them about inch high fold them in half and roll or pat them out to inch thickness again Then turn the dough degrees and fold and roll again You can do this folding and rolling anywhere from times to create those fancy biscuit flakes that are so amazing to behold Or you can do as I do and skip that folding entirely They re less flaky but more tender because the dough has been handled less I have had very few complaints usually because everyone was too busy stuffing their faces You can cut out biscuit rounds with a glass dipped in flour but I usually just cut them into squares handle LESS If you like the edges crispy cook them on a cookie sheet possibly greased I haven t ever tried it with a greased cookie sheet though without letting their sides touch If you like the edges soft bake in a greased this one does for sure need to be greased cake pan or brownie tin all smooshed in there together and be sure to reserve the centermost one for yourself Again they don t improve with time Biscuits are not something you make in advance While many people like to stir in things like cheese or herbs into their biscuits if you want to add them with the dry ingredients after you ve cut in the fat I never do I figure that s why mankind or more likely womankind till some rock n roll spiky haired barrel chested chef dudes showed up to take credit for it invented scones for Attack of the SconesOne time back when I had only two children zero jobs and an exceptionally clean house I did this big elaborate Christmas gift for my entire family called Attack of the Scones where I made several kinds of scones and homemade jam to go with them One of the nicest things about scones is that unlike biscuits they keep for a while without turning into desiccated hockey pucks lending themselves to being sent through the mail in happier times when everything wasn t coated with viruses or at least they were viruses we already knew and loved c flour ¬Ω c sugar you can reduce this by a couple T if you prefer a less sweet bread but y tho T baking powder OR t baking soda and t cream of tartar if you re out of baking powder and some people prefer scones this way ¬Ω t salt ¬Ω c margarine or Butter Flavored Crisco OR ¬º c margarine and ¬º c Butter Flavored Crisco egg ¬Ω c whole milk cream or buttermilk or slightly thinned out yogurt or sour cream Record scratch What the actual eff Margarine or Crisco instead of butter Your eyes do not deceive you Dear Readers When I did my Attack of the Scones project I used margarine because buying enough butter to make scones for people would have bankrupted me And much to my surprise I found I liked them better with margarine They were softer and lasted longer before they dried out No longer did my scones taste like biscuits with crap in them they were their own thing entirely And because you generally put a lot of other stuff into scones to flavor them you don t even notice the difference in taste Butter is great of course and you go right ahead and sub it in if you like or go halfsies but considering that my husband just had to rochambeau an elderly woman for the last package of butter in Eastern Washington it seems to me that a recipe involving margarine or shelf stable Crisco may just be a nice addition to our arsenal in the Time of Corona Optional added to the dry ingredients before cutting in the fat Herbs perhaps obviously in a less sweet scone spices citrus zest Optional added to the wet ingredients Extracts like vanilla almond etc Optional added to the dry ingredients AFTER cutting in the fat but before adding the wet ingredients chocolate chips nuts poppy seeds berries dried fruit cheese a SMALL amount of oats go easy with this as a few oats go a long way in scones You may need to add a smidge more liquid if you use them Optional on top of the scones after you ve cut them out and put them on your baking sheet a light brush of milk or melted butter no margarine for this part it makes ur scones soggy and or a sprinkling of sugar or maybe a few sliced or chopped nuts Optional on top of the scones after baking a confectioner s sugar glaze or a drizzle of honey I find these also make the scones soggy but if you re eating them fast why not You mix and bake your scones exactly like you do biscuits but definitely use a greased sheet for this one as the sugar makes them stickier and keep a close eye on them as the sugar and then whatever you mixed into them also makes them burnier The only difference is you dispense with all the folding and re rolling that you never did anyway if you are me and pat the dough into a rough circle and cut it like you would a pizza yielding pretty triangle scones Unlike biscuits they ll last a couple days at room temp provided they are not very moist due to fresh berries or glazes if they are best to keep them in the fridge to prevent mold or bacterial growth and a couple months wrapped in the freezer But maybe that all seems like a lot of work Cutting fat into dry ingredients Ain t nobody got time for that So let s make muffins instead Everyday MuffinsIn order to make muffins you need one thing though and that is a muffin tin If you have those little muffin papers they re handy but not necessary Just grease up that muffin tin like you re preparing your children to spend minutes outside before they get bored and come back in with their eyes stinging from all the sunscreen you smeared onto them Slather that grease in every nook and cranny because muffins will stick even in the most non stickiest of pans Everyday Muffins are everyday muffins because they aren t those huge super sweet cakey muffins you can get at the bakery They are more like a bread even the sweet ones and less like a dessert I ve never found a good recipe for the fancy bakery style muffins if you have please let me know in the comments This recipe will make muffins c flour ¬Ω ‚Öî c sugar obvs if you like a sweeter muffin use the greater amount of sugar T baking powder ¬Ω t salt egg and ‚Öî c whole milk OR eggs and ¬Ω c whole milk either works you may like the texture better one way or maybe you re running low on eggs or have eggs to use up t vanilla if making a sweet muffin otherwise you may skip this ¬Ω c oil ONLY no melted butter coconut oil or fat replacers Wait what Why oil only Why not melted butter or coconut oil or applesauce to make them fat free Well firstly because we re trying to think of things we can cook from our pantry which typically has oil in it and secondly I just like muffins better when they re made with oil They re more economical and easier with less cleanup and I think they re moister and have a better texture with oil You of course can use melted butter or coconut oil instead but for the love of God do not use applesauce or ground flaxseed or egg whites or whatever as a fat replacer If the s taught us nothing it is that fat cannot be replaced and trying to replace something irreplaceable simply makes us eat more sugar while wondering why we all hate our miserable pointless lives Trust me you re better off eating one delectable muffin with fat and being satiated than eating Snackwells Cookies and then being hungry minutes later The way to make muffins is quite easy way more so than biscuits No screwing around cutting in your fat Just mix together the dry ingredients in one bowl and the wet ingredients in another bowl and then add the wet ingredients to the dry ones Mix them as little as humanly possible I cook my muffins at way lower temps than others recommend I m a girl all the way Most recipes do call for or even but I think you should heed my advice and cook them at the lower temp Otherwise what often happens is there s a thick chewy crust and not in a good way at the bottom of the muffin that detracts from the goodness of the whole You can add pretty much whatever you want to this Using cups of stir ins per batch is generally plenty A cup or two of berries whole or chopped some cinnamon and a cup of raisins a half package of mini chocolate chips some orange zest and half a sack of cranberries or Craisins lemon zest lemon extract poppy seed some chopped apple and walnut pieces Cut back a little on the milk and add a mashed ripe banana I just made a tolerable cinnamon green tea muffin this very morning since I didn t have any good stir ins on hand You can fill your muffin tin half full then put in a spoon of jam and then top with the rest of your muffin batter for a surprise If you want a savory muffin be sure to reduce the sugar if you do you can try Swiss cheese and bacon cheddar and green chili sun dried tomato and basil even some cooked crumbled breakfast sausage there is no right or wrong when it comes to muffins save one rule if your muffins have meat or are on the moister side you should keep them refrigerated rather than out on the counter Do not use this recipe as a basis for bran muffins oatmeal muffins and corn muffins The rules for them are different since they themselves are grain ish things and they change the chemistry of it Bran and oatmeal muffins are muffins for another day but corn muffins are the bastard child of cornbread which we re going to talk about right about NOW CornbreadI love cornbread It s quick and easy I serve it often with soup chili and baked beans I personally prefer soup with cornbread in it rather than saltines And all this time I have never found a better recipe than the good old Albers back of the box special So here it is courtesy of Continental Mills Inc c Albers corn meal c flour ¬º c granulated sugar T baking powder t salt c milk ‚Öì c oil large egg And a greased I mean lay on that grease like John Travolta s hair in inch square pan I often double this recipe and cook it in my brownie pan instead I think that s √ó but math is not my strong suit and it works out Now I will diverge from the fine people of Albers and tell you how I mix and cook their recipe Technically you make cornbread like you do muffins dry ingredients in one bowl wet ingredients in the other bowl mix em together When I do that I find I end up with an extra bowl to wash and I don t have a dishwasher so extra bowls are something I try to avoid when I can I usually just mix the dry ingredients in one bowl then make a little well in the middle and pour in the milk the oil and the egg If you act fast they don t soak in much and so you can whisk them all together and end up with an evenly distributed mixture Cornbread is pretty forgiving of a little extra whisking though Don t try this with muffins it might end in disaster Pour it into your greased pan and bake at again I digress from the standard temp instructions I like my cornbread like I like myself very very very blonde and rather soft in the middle and err on the side of taking it out when it s barely cooked through rather than waiting till it s golden brown Ye olde toothpick in the middle test works wonders here Unless you like cornbread cooked longer in which case bake it at for minutes like the Albers people suggest If you want corn muffins bake the batter in a muffin tin I know this information may shock you keep it secret keep it safe They also have fancy pans shaped like ears of corn and other Southwest ephemera if you go in for that type of thing And you can even cook it in a cast iron skillet just grease it really well You can add crumbled bacon shredded cheese green chilis or even jalapenos but I rarely do as I just prefer the simplicity of the cornbread itself and the additions often interfere with my enjoyment of whatever soup ish type thing I made to go with it Some people particularly Southerners prefer a not even a little bit sweet cornbread made with white cornmeal and I have fond recollections from childhood of a super sweet super moist cornbread that was practically a dessert food I have not tracked down good recipes for either of these things not for lack of trying where the latter is concerned so if you have them please share Wouldn t it be nice if there was something kind of exactly like cornbread only made with regular old flour Well luckily there is Irish Soda BreadIt would have been great if I had written this article last month in preparation for St Patrick s Day but I didn t even know the world was running out of yeast at that point They really need to keep me apprised so I can plan my writing in advance of unexpected global developments It is my understanding this is not a super authentic recipe authentic Irish soda bread is made with only ingredients one of which is REAL full fat buttermilk I ve never made it that way I ve used this riff on a recipe from my old Better Homes and Gardens cookbook I got a million years ago when I was first married instead and since we are cooking from our pantries here I figure it s not likely many of us have any real full fat buttermilk in the fridge right now so to ¬Ω c flour start with and see how it goes you can always add more but you can t take it out again t salt t baking soda t baking powder optional and probably not necessary T granulated sugar OR honey depending on how sweet you want this if using honey you may need a bit more flour T this is half a stick of cold butter OR ¬º c melted butter this is also half a stick egg but only if using the cold butter and thanks to Sally s Baking Addiction for this tip ¬æ c buttermilk or you can use the trick I mentioned above to sour regular whole milk Optional t orange peel and c Craisins c plumped dried apricots chopped or c plumped raisins if using the extra sweetener t caraway seed or dill weed if using less sweetener you can plump your apricots or raisins by letting them set in your buttermilk for a while before draining the buttermilk off to be used in your bread Craisins are chemically treated so they typically stay soft unlike raisins and dried apricots and don t need plumping Note about the optional baking powder my original recipe had baking powder in addition to baking soda and buttermilk I started off making it this way but I found it had a faint chemically taste to it and honestly we really didn t love this bread compared to yeast bread for that reason Over time I reduced the baking powder to correct for that While I was doing research into soda bread for this article I learned that many people actually don t put ANY baking powder at all in their soda bread and I tried it that way as I tested this recipe It worked perfectly fine seemed to rise as high with no discernible difference in flavor so if you re out of baking powder you may want to skip it totally If you want the classic Irish Soda Break you will cut in your butter as you would with biscuits Mix the dry ingredients starting off with just c flour and then use your pastry cutter or the grated butter trick and proceed from there adding the egg and buttermilk to the coarse butter flour combo You may need to knead it with your hands to smoosh all the little pieces into the bread You ll possibly need to add some more flour beyond the original cups particularly if using honey but don t go overboard You basically need to just plop it on the baking sheet when you re done with it so it doesn t have to be completely unstickified to the furthest extent possible I rarely made soda bread except on St Pat s Day because it seemed so daunting to cut in the butter and then not even end up with a biscuit to show for it While I was writing this article I stumbled onto that Sally s Baking Addiction trick of melted butter no egg when trying to find a soda bread recipe that could be made with oil I never did find an oil based soda bread recipe so I must conclude that butter is of paramount importance here I haven t tried it but if you don t have an egg you may want to give Sally s method a whirl and if you do please report back Shape it into a not too thick blob I usually make mine all round and rustic but a square blob may be easier to divvy up evenly on a greased baking sheet Bake at again many people say but I think it dries out too much at the higher temp about minutes then cover the loaf with foil and continue cooking it another minutes it should take about minutes to cook if you want it extra crispy on the outside You could also use a skillet or a pie tin but be sure you ve greased them well You do NOT want to try to cram this into a loaf pan because it s not a yeast loaf and will not cook through if you don t allow it to spread out a bit If you want something that WILL go in a loaf pan Quick BreadI have long wondered why it is there s not just one standard recipe for quick bread and then you can just change it up by adding whatever you want to it Scientifically it makes sense that there isn t one as moist pureed ingredients like pumpkin and mashed banana would operate differently than zucchini or carrot or cranberry walnut but it just seems like a basic quick bread recipe is something that SHOULD exist As I was contemplating this article I got to thinking about this concept again and decided to have a look at the Internet to see if it could shed any light And lo and behold I found a very cool blog post in which Baker Bettie breaks down quick breads in about a jillion different ways including adding various ingredients and catering to differing dietary needs like gluten free and vegan and even explains how to make quick bread if you re out of baking powder I could never come up with something so thorough at least not without months of effort and this article has gotten long anyway so I direct you to Baker Bettie s site for no yeast required quick loaf bread directions please note I have not made these recipes personally And last but not least if you re wondering about the dark underbelly of the world of non yeast bread

5342,5342,"I replaced the plastic Normaflex 8mm coolant vent line with aluminum tubing as a preventative fix. Mine was still in good shape at 83k miles, but the plastic portion is known to fail. I used a 12"" length of 5/16"" OD 6061-T6 aluminum tubing with 0.049"" wall thickness (K&S Precision Metals 83062). 12"" is on the short side but will work - I recommend 14"" if available. To prevent the hoses from slipping off the tubing, I used a double-flare tool to put a ""bead"" on the tube ends. This is done by partially doing the first stage of the double-flare. I replaced the Oetiker clamps with spring clamps. I prefer spring clamps over hose clamps as they maintain constant pressure during expansion and contraction. The factory plastic tube has aluminum barbs at the end but the tube is a thin plastic, much like a drink straw. Cheap and easy job. Removing the factory plastic tube was a bit of a pain though. I lost no coolant and did not have to bleed the cooling system afterwards."

Going to change things up with Psychic types and go with Mr.Mime seeing as its obtained via in-game trade so training it won't be so hard. Machop is found prior to Rock Tunnel and the rest I get later on in the game. Although officially Water Types aren't banned, I have to grind Poliwag a lot to get it to where I can evolve it into Poliwhirl and ultimately Poliwrath to gain its Fighting Typing to make it legal.

8936,8936,Chanel No Hair Other Other Other Eyes Other Loooove it It is almost like No5 so if like the previous I am sure you like this one Hair Other Other Other Eyes Other This review is for the vintage EdT c Top Notes Tuberose Lily Neroli Lily of the Valley Orange Blossom Aldehydes Heart Notes Nutmeg White Rose Jasmine Ylang Ylang Base Notes Iris Vanilla Vetiver For a very long time I was afraid of No Its legendary aldehydes caused me to keep my distance If they were not enough to make me reticent in ordering it there was the unfortunate issue of poor performance to consider Frankly at Chanel prices it did not seem worth the risk However I recently had the opportunity to acquire a vintage EdT and I decided to take the plunge I more impressed than I ever thought I would be Wow No is a divine white floral It smells very French and very elegant Yes there are aldehydes that persist throughout the wearing but they are not the monsters I feared they would be Some people think No is version of No but I disagree No stands completely on her own merit and she smells much more elegant and refined than No No is the type of fragrance I envision being worn by a very refined very wealthy woman The beautiful white floral notes seem to float on the aldehydes It smells soapy clean and fresh Thus far I do not detect the incense that so many reviewers claim to detect To my nose this is simply while floral perfection I picture the woman who wears this as tall slender with porcelain like skin She wears her elegantly styled hair upswept and she is draped in the finest silk garments The story goes that whence Coco Chanel was ready to launch her first fragrance Ernest Beaux wanted her to choose No but she chose No instead All I can say is I agree with M Beaux Chanel should have taken his wise counsel The man was a genius I cannot wait to find out how No performs in cold weather I bet it will be stunning The vintage EdT has better than average projection sillage and longevity too Hair Brunette Other Other Eyes Brown This is a review of modern EdT I have numerous generously sized manufacturers samples When I dabbed it on I immediately thought No with more citrus neroli and a striking but fleeting effervescence A modern reinterpretation very recognizable and faithful to the original but perhaps skewing to a younger demographic because it is well bubbly A fragrantica review summed it up very well as a no flanker I do not find this as sweet as Cristalle EdT and even though I am not a fan of sweet florals I do prefer Cristalle I should confess that my taste does not run to abstract aldehydic floral category I am not a fan of the chanel treatment of aldehydes which goes soapy on my skin and I have grown from dislike to relatively indifference to my bottle of No vintage EdC which I have read is supposedly more animalic and muted I also read somewhere that Chanel famously used different formulas for EDT EdC and parfum In the floral aldehyde category I would probably prefer to wear Amouage Gold Est√©e Lauder Beautiful a more literal floral or Guerlain Chant de Aromes or a Nina Ricci Or Tamango by Leonard which is a softer aldehydic floral Or possibly Caron extrait Montaigne that I used to wear years ago It is somewhat presumptuous of me to dismiss this broad category I think aldehydes are present in many more types of fragrances but I can also intensely dislike EL white linen which some reviewers state was inspired by I do prefer the softer Guerlain aldehydic dry down which many modern wearers feel is too powdery I find that while I object to the massive amounts of powder in modern fragrances serge Lutens fumerie Turque but Guerlain extrait turns moistly pollinated not too throat parchingly dry I sadly do not get much incense in the base notes here If I do wear Chanel it will be my older bottles of EDT or Pour Monsieur I am a Galbanum fan Cristalle for summer only or an older version of les Exclusives il de bois the jury is still undecided on Les exclusives Cuir de Russie I have a sizable decant of Coromandel that I thought I would adore but sadly I do not EDIT its the start of autumn and il de Bois is a bit too sweet on me now I am getting finder if CdR but possibly Knize ten is a better fit And coromandel is growing on me For the modern woman who loves No I imagine that this would be a perfect every day scent in all but price I have so much perfume that I try not to buy large bottles of anything anymore In fact the sole reason I am testing this is that I am actively trying to use my samples

Oh, and cat lovers preferred. Sweet, I like your description and after reading the follow-up posts to your post I quoted above I think the gang has been giving you a pretty hard time over it, and I just want you to know that I'm with you not them! I admire a woman who knows what she wants, and even more so that you can come up with such a detailed list than as you said saying simply, ""Cute."" I predict that you will find or have already found somebody who meets most of what you want, and you will probably just forget your list when you start getting into that person. My own experience is that I'd rather stick with one definition, like how I define art. I can't define it but I know it when I see it. That's how I feel about attractiveness of women. Just to give an example from my personal life, women I've dated this year who I thought we could possibly become an item. That's maybe several or ten , and about the only conclusion I could draw is that they are all women, and are within a few inches shorter than I to maybe one inch over, a few years younger than I to a few years older. ? To be fair I think their personalities would be more similar, high energy, creative, into fitness, intellectually smart women, outgoing. I don't know who has it easier Sweet, you or I. You have a list but I suspect your list is an ideal and that you'll end up with somebody who makes some of your list. Myself, I just look at an OLD profile picture and use my intuitive feelings to decide if that person attracts me. Keep going! I just know you are one of the winners who will cross the finish line in triumph!"

987,987,FILE PHOTO L R Judges of the Court of Final Appeal Andrew Cheung Kui nung Robert Ribeiro and Secretary of Justice Teresa Cheng attend a By Greg Torode and James Pomfret HONG KONG Reuters The independence of Hong Kong s judicial system is under assault from the Communist Party leadership in Beijing senior judges in the city told Reuters posing the gravest threat to the rule of law since Britain handed its former colony back to Chinese sovereignty in Even as the novel coronavirus has brought the protests in Hong Kong to a near standstill the struggle rages on over the future of China s freest city Three of Hong Kong s most senior judges told Reuters that the independent judiciary the cornerstone of the city s broad freedoms is in a fight for its survival Beijing s effort to hobble the judiciary is multi pronged according to more than two dozen interviews with judges leading lawyers and diplomats in Hong Kong The state controlled press on the mainland has warned Hong Kong judges not to absolve protesters arrested during last year s demonstrations Judges and lawyers say there are signs Beijing is trying to limit the authority of Hong Kong courts to rule on core constitutional matters And people close to the city s top judge Geoffrey Ma say he has to contend with Communist Party officials pushing Beijing s view that the rule of law ultimately must be a tool to preserve one party rule That tension flared into view last September when Ma spoke at the International Bar Association conference in Seoul about the rule of law including the extensive human rights protections built into Hong Kong s legal system Judges must not be influenced by extraneous factors such as politics Hong Kong s chief justice said As Ma finished said three witnesses a representative from AllBright Law Offices a leading mainland Chinese legal firm that co sponsored the lunch event rushed to the podium to object to what he said was a political speech by the chief justice Amid gasps and snorts of derision the man was escorted from the microphone the witnesses said AllBright did not respond to questions Some in the city s legal establishment are now bracing for the possibility that China will begin to meddle in the appointment of new judges following objections by some pro Beijing lawmakers in Hong Kong to two recent appointments on the top court With the search currently underway for at least one new justice for the top court the three judges who spoke to Reuters said they feared vacancies could create an opening for Beijing Any intervention in the selection process said one of the justices would likely spark resignations on the bench We are worried that they are losing patience and will find ways of tightening the screws the judge said referring to the Beijing leadership We know from our interactions with senior mainland judges that they just do not get Hong Kong at all said the justice who spoke on condition of anonymity They always want to know why Hong Kong is so confused and chaotic and not patriotic A spokesman for Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said the central government in Beijing had time and again made it clear that it would continue to fully implement the one country two systems principle guiding Hong Kong s autonomous relationship with its Chinese sovereign Beijing he added was committed to the Basic Law the city s mini constitution that protects its rights and freedoms The Chinese authorities did not respond to questions from Reuters MASS PROTESTSDeepening concern over Beijing s meddling in the affairs of Hong Kong fueled the mass protests that erupted last year The unrest was set off by a perceived assault on the judicial system The city s government proposed a bill that would have allowed for the extradition of defendants to mainland China where the courts are tightly controlled by the Communist Party The government ultimately withdrew the bill as the protests mushroomed but by then opposition to the legislation had escalated into a broad movement for greater democracy The demonstrators have occasionally focused their anger on the courts which are handling the cases of thousands of protesters who face criminal charges Late last year some demonstrators lobbed petrol bombs outside the entrance to the Court of Final Appeal and the High Court building A Reuters poll in March showed that even with the protests dying down amid the pandemic support for the demands of pro democracy protesters has grown Backing for universal suffrage in Hong Kong for instance rose to from in December Support for the protests remained strong at compared with previously Beijing denies intervening in the running of Hong Kong It has blamed Western forces for spurring unrest in the city Still many residents fear that the one country two systems formula agreed when the city was handed over to China by Britain in is being further eroded Responding to questions from Reuters a judiciary spokeswoman said Ma would not offer any comment The judiciary is now at the heart of the battle over Hong Kong s autonomy These conflicts are playing out largely behind the scenes in the rarefied atmosphere of the city s judicial corridors With their horse hair wigs and ceremonial robes Hong Kong s judges symbolize one of the core promises of the handover the right to a fair trial and equality under the law all administered by an independent judiciary Such rights a British legacy do not exist on the mainland Yet they are written into the Basic Law Hong Kong s mini constitution Those rights have long been touted frequently by the Hong Kong government as the bedrock beneath one of the world s most important financial cities Significantly they include the right of Hong Kong s chief justice to appoint foreign judges But the Basic Law contains a caveat Ultimately the rulings of Hong Kong s top court the Court of Final Appeal can be re interpreted by the standing committee of the National People s Congress China s parliament Beijing last used that power in late to effectively bar several pro democracy lawmakers from taking office The three judges who spoke to Reuters said they feared China would begin to wield this power more frequently potentially undermining the city s courts In November a Hong Kong court overturned a government emergency ban on protesters wearing masks to obscure their faces The next day state news agency Xinhua quoted a spokesman for a body attached to the standing committee saying that Hong Kong courts had no power to rule on the constitutionality of the city s laws The announcement was swiftly condemned by local lawyers and local and foreign academics The Hong Kong government partially won an appeal last week against the November decision THE MESSAGE TO HONG KONGChina s state controlled media weighed in as protests intensified last year The Global Times a tabloid published by the Communist Party s People s Daily wrote in a November commentary The rule of law can save Hong Kong but the premise is that the rioters must be punished It added Just like the rioters the judges and lawyers who absolve rioters of their crimes will be despised Writing in a Communist Party journal last year Chinese leader Xi Jinping explained his view on the rule of law The socialist rule of law must adhere to the party s leadership he wrote in the journal Qiushi which means Seeking Truth China Xi said must not copy other countries nor follow Western style judicial independence China s leaders have made their expectations of Hong Kong clear Last year in Beijing Vice Premier Han Zheng publicly told the city s chief executive Carrie Lam that stopping the violence was the common responsibility of her government the legislature and the judiciary In so saying Han blurred the lines of Hong Kong s separation of powers a check on the state that does not exist on the mainland And this month a top Chinese official in Hong Kong wrote about the need for strengthening the city s legal system to safeguard China s national security Under their oath of office Hong Kong s judges must steer clear of the political fray Following Han s remarks though one justice used his ruling on a matter related to the protests and freedom of the press to stress the doctrine of separate powers As an aside Justice Russell Coleman wrote two days after Han s remarks I do not think any judicial officer in Hong Kong requires anyone whether from in Hong Kong or beyond to tell him or her how to perform his or her role as part of the independent judiciary The judiciary said Coleman had no comment The rule of law and an independent judiciary are constitutionally protected by the Basic Law Lam s spokesman said Some in Hong Kong believe Beijing will struggle to bring the city s judicial system to heel The roots of the common law run deep in Hong Kong and will not be easily uprooted so I think China can only ultimately take a gradual approach despite the rhetoric said Simon Young a barrister and professor at the University of Hong Kong s law school Those values are entrenched through the system Young was encouraged by what he said were the robust public defenses of the city s judicial system being mounted by Hong Kong s top judge Ma as well as Coleman and others A retired senior judge speaking on condition of anonymity said while the mainland is clearly trying to pressure Hong Kong s judiciary it does not amount to an existential threat to the rule of law The test the former judge said would be if the legal system succumbed to these pressures I have not seen that SPEAKING UP FOR THE RULE OF LAW Ma became chief justice of the Court of Final Appeal in after a long career as a barrister and a High Court judge Amid the drama that s shaken his city in the past year he has forcefully defended judicial independence Concluding his speech in Seoul last year Ma told the audience Speaking up for the rule of law as it is properly understood is very much a part of what a lawyer should be doing Look within yourselves and ask whether you are prepared to stand up and be counted At a public appearance in January in Hong Kong Ma again addressed judicial independence He repeatedly told reporters he could not discuss the political or even the legal questions raised by the statements of the leadership in Beijing But he did note The powers of the courts by the way are stated in the Basic Law Hong Kong is to have independent judicial power and those words mean exactly what they say Ma went further Judges do not look at the litigant s background nor his political stance he said Destroying the rule of law is when the court thinks not everyone is equal before the law and that some are more equal than others Several friends and former colleagues of Ma say he is showing signs of strain from the job including having to continually defend the integrity of the courts This was evident they say when Ma appeared at the January event a start of the year gathering of judges leading lawyers and senior government officials and diplomats Ma confirmed that it would be his last time opening the annual event and that he would be retiring in January next year when he turns forgoing his option of an extension By then he would have served more than a decade as chief justice Ma is only the second person to serve in the position since the handover His successor will be Justice Andrew Cheung who sits on the Court of Final Appeal and whose appointment was announced in March The judiciary said Cheung had no comment for this article Some people close to Ma say that while he has not been pushed to leave the constant battle to safeguard the judiciary has worn on him His job includes dealing with visiting mainland judges and briefings from locally based Chinese officials which can be tough going these people say While they apparently know better than to meddle in individual cases say the people close to Ma the Chinese judges and officials constantly seek to push Beijing s patriotic agenda by stressing the importance of the judiciary in defending China s sovereignty and national security I know he tires of the apparatchiks whose Communist Party mantra has no room for even starting to grasp the separation of powers that exists in Hong Kong or the real meaning or value of judicial independence said one person who knows the chief justice Sometimes he stops engaging and simply tries to talk football APPOINTING NEW JUDGESMa is looking forward to a rest and having time to indulge in his lifelong passions for cinema cricket and England s Manchester United football team say those who know him Hong Kong born and British educated Ma mixes easily in international legal circles as he recruits judicial talent from abroad foreign envoys and judges say His ability to continue to attract leading foreign judges to serve on Hong Kong courts is a source of pride for him The Court of Final Appeal currently has judges of whom are foreigners Many are from the United Kingdom Canada and Australia All serve as non permanent members on the court which means they are called on periodically to sit on cases Their presence stems from an arrangement established at the handover that has become an entrenched part of the city s judicial system All cases reaching Hong Kong s highest court the Court of Final Appeal including key constitutional and human rights matters are generally adjudicated by a panel of five judges This includes the chief justice three permanent judges and one non permanent judge Ma is now leading the hunt for at least one new member on the highest court in his statutory role as head of a committee that handles judicial appointments The selection body known as the Judicial Officers Recommendation Commission comprises judges senior lawyers and prominent community figures as well as a government representative the secretary for justice They are barred by law from talking about their work Any key documentation they use is hand delivered across the city The question is whether outside forces will try to meddle when decisions need approval said a person with direct knowledge of the panel s secret deliberations who spoke on condition of anonymity I have to have faith the system will work but it hangs by only a convention The appointments must be approved by city Chief Executive Carrie Lam and the legislature Traditionally they have been approved with little fuss But some of the commission s last significant appointments encountered rare scrutiny in when some pro Beijing lawmakers questioned the candidacies in the legislature as well as the selection process itself Brenda Hale then president of the British Supreme Court and Beverley McLachlin former Chief Justice of Canada were the first women to be appointed to Hong Kong s highest court Pro Beijing legislators questioned whether they were too socially liberal for Hong Kong based on their past rulings The judiciary said Hale and McLachlin had no comment The appointments were eventually approved but the message had been sent Ma and his successors could expect future fights over appointments particularly of foreign judges That was a shot across the bows said one of the three senior judges who spoke to Reuters We all heard it Another of the justices told Reuters he is concerned that a generational shift underway on the bench could leave it starved of judges strong enough to withstand meddling in the years ahead Pressures will build on the new judicial leaders the judge said Some of us doubt that they will be able to withstand those pressures as previous generations have done We just have to hope they can the judge said The rule of law will depend on it Reporting by Greg Torode and James Pomfret Additional reporting by Clare Jim and Anne Marie Roantree in Hong Kong Edited by Peter Hirschberg

I wasnt ready. Banks would have laughed at me anyways. I also didnt want to rent. So, I did stay at home for about 5 years (It's a big house, and me and parents got on well). I decided I was going to buy a brand new car for myself, while still saving. It would also show my ability to repay a loan. I paid 10k for the car myself. And got a 5k loan. I did that (I still have this car). Then decided that I was going to enjoy life. I went off on long holidays and doing interesting things. And going out a lot etc. I reckoned my time would come. Mid 30s, I got a promotion. Which enabled me to seriously consider a mortgage. Then I happened to inherit a plot of land. Currently, am building. I get that people want their own stuff and place. We (as Irish) seem obsessed to own something. What I also dont get is the urgency and the ""want it now"" attitude people have adopted. Same with jobs. I just dont get it. Would ye not prefer to enjoy the ride? To me sometimes its like throwing toys out of a pram. Youre late 20s for goodness sake. Enjoy your life! Someone who was literally gifted their entire life through pure luck (being able to stay at home until their thirties, inheriting a plot of land) is calling other people spoiled? Absolutely hilarious. Most people don't have the option to stay at home past 18, either because of family problems or because they have to move for work. Most people don't get given plots of land for free. Maybe if you'd spent over a decade paying 600+ euros plus bills to rent a ****ty room in a house, sharing with flatmates into your thirties, you'd also have a 'want it now' attitude towards buying a home and gaining some quality of life."

No staff required. 2) Plenty of park space, including a new park coming into our downtown core, which would be far from most hockey players, it would make a lovely backdrop and be a not super hard sell considering there's already massive renovations happening.3) City would. If it's in the park I'd most like it to be, parking and noise are a non-issue as it'd be located in a very large park with plenty of parking and noise issues are a non-starter because they have a skeet shooting range in the park. There's also a skate park, ""All Play"" baseball field, 4 baseball/softball fields, a Frolf Course, A Splash pad, A soap box derby track and a track for wire flying or whatever that's called. So it's almost like the experimental park of sorts for all the things. It's also located ~10 minutes away from 4 of the 7 year round rinks, so theoretically it's a good proximity for hockey players.4) Obviously a roof would be ideal since we're in the midwest and get every type of weather, but I'd be happy with the proof of concept just being the most basic bitch thing imaginable."

This isn't a new thing at all, in my first game, Pokemon Yellow, I used all three sparingly and tore through with a Nidoking instead (using one pokemon like many small children do). My next one was Emerald where I actually used Sceptile. Since that Emerald game I have never really used my starter again since (FR/LG, Diamond, Coliseum, XD, and a billion different Roms).

4619,4619,Lent is the forty days before Easter Start at Easter back up six Sundays then back up a few more days to the Wednesday before and you get to Ash Wednesday That s actually forty six days Back out the six Sundays which are treated as free days and not counted as part of the Lenten season they are and they aren t it s complicated and you get to forty days Lent is a season of preparation for Easter We prepare by focusing on Christ and his journey to the Cross which lies squarely across our path and looms ever larger the deeper we get into the Lenten season The days of Lent tie in directly with the days Jesus spent in the wilderness prior to the start of his public ministry and indirectly with the years Israel spent in the wilderness prior to entering the Promised Land Not all of us can go out into the wilderness for days but we can all place ourselves in a posture of humility and choose practices consistent with a lifestyle of repentance What we typically do around here during the Lenten season is pick a related topic and talk about it for the next five to six weeks This year we are looking at the Gospel of John Specifically we are looking at seven supernatural occurrences around which John organizes his account of the life of Jesus These occurrences are called signs because they are not random occurrences but because they point to something namely Jesus identity as the Son of God and as Israel s long awaited Messiah This week we will look at the sixth sign One of the key underlying themes in this story is a question with which any person of faith Christian or otherwise has wrestled at least once many who have given up on faith did so because they could not resolve the tension in this question The question How can a good God allow evil in the world John s answer as shown in this story would likely be thus God and evil can coexist I ve seen it happen But it doesn t look like what you would think Over the course of John s account Jesus and his disciples have been bouncing back and forth between Judea and Galilee Galilee is up north It is safe space it is where Jesus family friends and supporters live Judea especially Jerusalem is dangerous territory Why Because anytime Jesus appears in Jerusalem he stirs up the people And the Jewish religious leaders don t want that because if the people get stirred up then Rome gets stirred up And when Rome gets stirred up bad things happen This week Jesus is in the Jerusalem area again and for the reasons given above his disciples are on edge Repeatedly the temple leaders have asked Jesus are you the Messiah Don t keep us in suspense Tell us straight out once and for all I did tell you Jesus said I ve shown you You just don t want to see So now Jesus goes all out His intent is to manufacture a sign so undeniable that it will force the religious leaders hands He heads to a small town just outside Jerusalem and that is where our story picks up Now a man named Lazarus was sick He was from Bethany the village of Mary and her sister Martha This Mary whose brother Lazarus now lay sick was the same one who poured perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair So the sisters sent word to Jesus Lord the one you love is sick When he heard this Jesus said This sickness will not end in death No it is for God s glory so that God s Son may be glorified through it Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus So when he heard that Lazarus was sick he stayed where he was two more days and then he said to his disciples Let us go back to Judea But Rabbi they said a short while ago the Jews there tried to stone you and yet you are going back Jesus answered Are there not twelve hours of daylight Anyone who walks in the daytime will not stumble for they see by this world s light It is when a person walks at night that they stumble for they have no light After he had said this he went on to tell them Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep but I am going there to wake him up His disciples replied Lord if he sleeps he will get better Jesus had been speaking of his death but his disciples thought he meant natural sleep So then he told them plainly Lazarus is dead and for your sake I am glad I was not there so that you may believe But let us go to him Then Thomas also known as Didymus said to the rest of the disciples Let us also go that we may die with him On his arrival Jesus found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days Now Bethany was less than two miles from Jerusalem and many Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them in the loss of their brother When Martha heard that Jesus was coming she went out to meet him but Mary stayed at home Lord Martha said to Jesus if you had been here my brother would not have died But I know that even now God will give you whatever you ask Jesus said to her Your brother will rise again Martha answered I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day Jesus said to her I am the resurrection and the life The one who believes in me will live even though they die and whoever lives by believing in me will never die Do you believe this Yes Lord she replied I believe that you are the Messiah the Son of God who is to come into the world After she had said this she went back and called her sister Mary aside The Teacher is here she said and is asking for you When Mary heard this she got up quickly and went to him Now Jesus had not yet entered the village but was still at the place where Martha had met him When the Jews who had been with Mary in the house comforting her noticed how quickly she got up and went out they followed her supposing she was going to the tomb to mourn there When Mary reached the place where Jesus was and saw him she fell at his feet and said Lord if you had been here my brother would not have died When Jesus saw her weeping and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled Where have you laid him he asked Come and see Lord they replied Jesus wept Then the Jews said See how he loved him But some of them said Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying Jesus once more deeply moved came to the tomb It was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance Take away the stone he said But Lord said Martha the sister of the dead man by this time there is a bad odor for he has been there four days Then Jesus said Did I not tell you that if you believe you will see the glory of God So they took away the stone Then Jesus looked up and said Father I thank you that you have heard me I knew that you always hear me but I said this for the benefit of the people standing here that they may believe that you sent me When he had said this Jesus called in a loud voice Lazarus come out The dead man came out his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen and a cloth around his face Jesus said to them Take off the grave clothes and let him go Therefore many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary and had seen what Jesus did believed in him But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin What are we accomplishing they asked Here is this man performing many signs If we let him go on like this everyone will believe in him and then the Romans will come and take away both our temple and our nation Then one of them named Caiaphas who was high priest that year spoke up You know nothing at all You do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish He did not say this on his own but as high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of God to bring them together and make them one So from that day on they plotted to take his life Therefore Jesus no longer moved about publicly among the people of Judea Instead he withdrew to a region near the wilderness to a village called Ephraim where he stayed with his disciples When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover many went up from the country to Jerusalem for their ceremonial cleansing before the Passover They kept looking for Jesus and as they stood in the temple courts they asked one another What do you think Isn t he coming to the festival at all But the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that anyone who found out where Jesus was should report it so that they might arrest him John Right off the bat we learn that Jesus had a purpose in all this This delves into nature it was left unattended on purpose Jesus purposes Sickness for the glory of God was a completely and totally new category in that religious culture Realizing that Jesus words would likely sound crass John jumps in with an editorial comment to reassure the reader that Jesus did in fact love Mary and Martha and Lazarus Jesus then proceeds to stay on with his disciples for two more days He is staging a sign here a sign with a purpose He had healed sick people all day long but for him to do what he is about to do that will kick it up several notches Finally Jesus returns His disciples try desperately to talk him out of it As noted above anytime they are in or near Jerusalem the disciples are on edge for Jesus life and their own as well Jesus response Are there not twelve hours of daylight Anyone who walks in the daytime will not stumble for they see by this world s light It is when a person walks at night that they stumble for they have no light Translation hours of daylight = hours of opportunity Follow the light of the world that would be me while you still can You can stay here if you want but if you do you will miss the opportunity of a lifetime Finally the disciples give in Thomas speaks up and says what they are all thinking Let us go so that we may die with him They get to Bethany and by that point Lazarus had been in the tomb for four days They were just wrapping up the funeral service Martha goes out to meet Jesus and comes at him with the full force of her raw humanity Lord if you had been here my brother would not have died But I am sure that even now God will give you whatever you ask trying desperately to cling to some last sliver of faith in that moment Your brother will rise again says Jesus I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day says Martha Translation Don t try to comfort me with your theology I ve already read all the books and I know all the verses and it is no comfort to me If you had been here a couple of days ago we wouldn t be waiting for the last day I am the resurrection says Jesus You don t have to wait for the last day The last day is right here with you right now Now Mary comes out to meet Jesus and what we see here is divine empathy Jesus knows fully how all of this is going to play out yet he does not rush through to the happy ending Instead he enters into the moment and is fully present with his friends in their grief even to the point of weeping himself At no point did Jesus offer any of the pious cliches and platitudes that we have come to expect in moments like this Nothing like God will never give more than you can handle If God brought you to it he will bring you through it With God everything happens for a reason though in this case we know from earlier in the story that this did happen for a reason or my all time favorite and likely yours too God is in control We know how the story ends Per John s account many who saw this go down believed in Jesus That s John s MO Seeing leads to believing which in turn leads to trusting in Jesus Now the soundtrack shifts This was so indisputable a sign that those who were willfully blind had to act immediately The sign had had its desired effect it had forced the hands of the Jewish religious leaders If we let him go on like this Note the supreme arrogance in that statement Elsewhere in John s account Jesus states I lay down my life and take it up again so no one is letting Jesus do anything or stopping him from doing anything everyone will believe in him and then the Romans will come and take away both our temple and our nation said the religious leaders They had that part right They had no idea This ties back to the beginning of John s account Light has come into the world but some people loved the darkness
11828,11828,"Well, what I thought was probably a blown engine, probably a head gasket, and the end of my history with this van, turned out to be a broken plastic connector in the cooling system. I have no idea what this connector is called, and I need some help with that (so I can find a new one) and with getting it disconnected. It's a quick connect of some kind, but I have not been able to get it disconnected. Here are some pictures for your viewing pleasure. These were all taken with the air intake removed, looking into the engine compartment from the front. This connector is above, in front of, and to the left (passenger side) of the throttle body. What is this beast called? The connector in question is just below the yellow arrow. The hose that connects to it is seen in the yellow circle. A close up of the connector and its hose. Close up of the connector. How do I disconnect this? I have tried pressing in the white plastic piece in the little window, with no success. It has a twin on the other side of the connector. Neither will budge. I'm pretty sure they are supposed to be pressed in simultaneously, but nothing is happening."

The debate was about whether it was stronger enough to be worth the extra effort. For example, if you can get a 1% damage boost from purple, but lose it in 10 hits, and lose 10% damage when you drop to white versus the set that just sticks to white, then the purple is still stronger ON PAPER, but it is not better in reality."

Of course though, Airsick disputes this too. I've said it a million times, these ideas have all been copied and implemented into this game, from other games. The skill system for instance, is almost a carbon copy of Victor Vrans skill system. The Account Leveling system is almost a carbon copy of Marvel Heroes Omega System (which is now a dead game). The cover system is almost a carbon copy from the cover system in games like The Division. The crafting timer is more or less a copy of Warframes crafting timer system. The War Zones that the dev's have been talking about, will likely be like Marvel Heroes midtown zone (Google Marvel Heroes Midtown). Basically, every single thing has all been done before. There isn't one original idea in this entire game. It's all copied from somewhere else, and it's all going to make 1 messy game. The devs have already had 1 delay, and they've already had to undo some of the work they did, because it didn't pan out. They're just filling it with junk mechanic after junk mechanic, because they think that's what makes the game fun, in their own little world. 't say ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• about what concepets were adapted from 't get TOO MUCH more original ideas into arpg's at this point. You were talking about fun 't really know until LAUNCH 't played a finished product. blah"

connecting flight out of New Zealand I will have barely hours at the airport just enough time to rush from the domestic terminal to the international terminal and do the check in immigration boarding etc I said to her Oh how sad I wish we could have spent some together she said Spoiled Brat took out a business card from her purse She gave the business card to me and said Uncle at least you give me a call from the airport when you reach Auckland and in case your flight is delayed or something I will try and come and meet you Suddenly the bus drivers called out to the passengers to board their

and have you seen the bathroom it is a dirty filthy mess all her underclothes are lying all over the bathroom she hasn t even bothered to flush the toilet and did you see the way she looked so slovenly did you see her face so sloppy and did you notice her hair so disheveled I doubt she even had a bath She must have been in a hurry What hurry I woke her up at o clock but she kept sleeping and then she rushes out leaving everything in a shabby mess does she expect me to clean her room and wash her clothes She must have I keep my house so spick and span in fact I had specially done up the room and bathroom for her and she has converted the whole place into a dirty filthy pigsty Maybe Look at her half eaten breakfast she just left her plate on the table she didn t even bother to put her dirty plate in the washbasin does she think I am a waitress Maybe she has servants at her home to do all her work so she may not be used to doing any work at home I don t know about that but her

pest control done Come on don t exaggerate and make a big issue Okay but next time you please ask me first before you invite anyone to stay at our home especially some disgusting spoiled brat like her my wife said firmly to me Okay Okay I said Dear Reader Let me tell you how spoiled brat had come to stay over at our place in Mumbai A few months ago I met a college classmate during an alumni meet at our college where our batch had assembled on the campus to celebrate the silver jubilee of our passing out on completion of our Engineering Degrees We exchanged contact details Then suddenly one day my classmate called me on phone and he requested me if his daughter could stay at our place for a day or two she was coming to Mumbai to appear for a Management CET Common Entrance Test for admission to Business Schools all over India There was no CET Exam Centre in the town where my classmate lived and his daughter had been allotted a centre in Mumbai which was located near my house So I said okay and I told him that his daughter was most welcome to stay with us in Mumbai And that is how Spoiled Brat came to stay with us in Mumbai for days After her stay with us when Spoiled Brat reached back to her home her father rang up to thank me for our hospitality But after that we lost contact And now after long years I had unexpectedly run into Spoiled Brat in a remote picturesque place called Lake Tekapo in New Zealand When Spoiled Brat had come to stay with us in Mumbai she must have been around years old Now when I met her in New Zealand she would have been in her early s PART Back to the Present One Week After I Met Spoiled Brat at Lake Tekapo MISSED CONNECTION Christchurch Auckland New Zealand Circa After spending a week enjoying the stunning scenery and awe inspiring sights of South New Zealand breathtaking Fiords fascinating Glaciers pristine Lakes spectacular cloud piercing Snow Covered Mountains and scenic Alpine Forests I sat in the aircraft at Christchurch Airport waiting for the early morning flight to Auckland to take off The entire schedule had gone off beautifully like clockwork and I was most happy with my tour of New Zealand especially South Island Now it was just a one hour twenty minute flight to Auckland and I would be well in time to catch my flight out of Auckland on my way home And then Murphy s Law happened if anything can go wrong it will There was some last minute glitch in the aircraft at Christchurch All passengers were asked to disembark As we sat in the lounge I heard an announcement that our flight would be delayed by one hour Already half an hour had passed since the scheduled departure of my flight I got anxious that I may miss my connecting flight from Auckland so I pleaded with the ground staff to accommodate me in the earliest flight to Auckland The ground staff said that my flight would depart in one hour for Auckland and they assured me that I would reach Auckland in time to catch my connecting flight But the flight got delayed further due to bad weather And I missed my connecting flight by a whisker PART NO SHOW Same Day Auckland Airport New Zealand Circa The moment my flight from Christchurch landed at Auckland Airport I rushed from the domestic terminal to the international terminal but I was just a few minutes late my flight had just taken off a few minutes earlier Sorry Sir your flight has just departed the girl at the check in counter said looking at my ticket Oh My God I said panicking Sir if you want we can book you on tomorrow s flight Tomorrow Yes Sir we have only one flight from Auckland Isn t there a flight today Sir you can try the other airlines but it is holiday season and all flights are likely to be fully booked I thought about it Out here in New Zealand I just had my Forex Card so the blunt fact was that I did not have money to book a ticket all the way back to India by another flight So I said to the girl Okay I hope you will keep me in a hotel Sir you are a No Show passenger so the airline is not responsible No Show Yes Sir you did an online check in yesterday and still you did not turn up for your flight on time But it is not my fault that my flight from Christchurch got delayed due to which I missed my connecting flight I know Sir but that was a different domestic airline on which you had booked a low cost discount ticket separately and with us you have a separate international non refundable ticket for your trip from Mumbai to Auckland and back This is really sad I said So I will have to wait at the airport for hours Sir if you want you can try the hotel outside the airport I don t have any money to stay in a hotel Sir you don t have any cards I just have a Forex Card and I think I have almost exhausted it today was supposed to my last day here Oh Sir then how are you going to pay for your new ticket from Auckland to Mumbai New ticket Yes Sir since you are a No Show passenger you will have to buy a new ticket What about this ticket which I have From your ticket it seems that you bought your ticket through a travel agent Yes I told a Travel Agency to plan my entire New Zealand itinerary Sir you can cancel the unused segments of the ticket and whatever money you are entitled will be credited to you via your travel agent Travel Agent Sir I am not very sure but I think whatever refund is due to the No Show passenger is generally credited to the same account or card from which the booking was done and in your case it seems that the Travel Agency paid the Airline for your ticket Yes They booked the tickets hotels tours travel arrangements everything and I just paid them the total amount by cheque So you will have to but a new ticket But I don t have money to buy a new ticket from Auckland to Mumbai I pleaded I told you that I am only carrying a Forex Card which has hardly any balance now since I used the card for my entire New Zealand trip Sir maybe you have someone here in New Zealand who can help you out the girl at the check in counter said I thought about it Did I know anyone here in New Zealand who could help me out Yes there was one person Spoiled Brat I was in a big trouble stranded at Auckland Airport Trapped in this hapless situation I had no choice but to call Spoiled Brat From my wallet I took out the Visiting Card that Spoiled Brat had given me in Tekapo and I dialed her mobile number Spoiled Brat seemed delighted to hear my voice I explained my predicament to her Uncle which is the airline on which you booked tickets Spoiled Brat asked me I told her the name of the airline Oh That s good The airline office is very near that place I work and I know someone who works there she said Uncle you do one thing Uncle you just take the SkyBus Airport to City Shuttle Bus and come here the ticket is quite cheap and you can pay with your Forex Card you will find a SkyBus Ticket Kiosk just outside the airport terminal there is a bus every minutes you just get down at the last stop at the terminus on Queen Street and the moment you reach there just give me a call I will come in minutes After the comforting conversation with Spoiled Brat I walked out of Auckland Airport I located the SkyBus Ticket Kiosk bought a ticket walked to the Bus Stop boarded the bus and soon I was travelling in the spacious bus through the scenic city of Auckland towards the Central Business District CBD to Queen Street where the SkyBus Terminus was located PART BROKE IN AUCKLAND Same Day Queen Street Central Business District CBD Auckland New Zealand Circa As the comfortable Bus approached the terminus almost an hour later I took out my mobile phone to call Spoiled Brat the moment the bus stopped But I did not have to call her as I was delighted to see Spoiled Brat waiting for me at the Airport Shuttle Terminus She was wearing a pretty dress and she looked lovely glowing face hair properly styled well groomed appearance full of poise refined polished elegant neat and clean a total transformation from her earlier shabby unkempt slovenly clumsy disheveled appearance when she stayed us in Mumbai many years ago She looked very charming chic graceful and elegant Yes Spoiled Brat looked really Tip Top smart glamorous pleasing and attractive Hello Uncle she said with a friendly smile so we are destined to meet again Yes I said Uncle is this all the luggage you have she asked pointing to my bag Yes only one small bag with wheels I like to travel light especially on solo tours where you have to cart your luggage all over That s great So first we will walk down to the Airline Office and get your ticket issue sorted out As we walked on Queen Street Spoiled Brat said to me Uncle I have a friend who works in the airline office she is a Kiwi of Indian Origin I am sure she will help us out I have already called her and she is waiting for us Yes the friend was waiting for us in the airline office She did her best possible so that I was charged the minimum penalty and she facilitated that instead of the undergoing the laborious process of obtaining a refund I got a new ticket for the next day s flight by just paying the difference between refund and fare Spoiled Brat paid for my air ticket by using her credit card and soon I had my ticket from Auckland to Mumbai in my hand Thanks a lot I said to Spoiled Brat It is okay Uncle did I say Thanks when I stayed with you in Mumbai I smiled to myself when I remembered the terrible memories of her stay at our place in Mumbai I owe you a lot of money I said to Spoiled Brat Don t worry Uncle you don t have to pay me now I have a bank account in India I will give you the details when you get back to India just transfer the money to my bank account in India I will use the money when I come to India for my summer vacation Okay Thanks a lot So now I have around hours to spend in Auckland can you find some accommodation for me some Backpackers place or Hostel not too expensive You are staying at my place Uncle she asserted No No please I will manage on my own I don t want to trouble you What trouble Uncle Didn t I stay at with you in Mumbai Was I any trouble to you I tried to suppress my laughter wondering what my wife would say It seemed that Spoiled Brat read my thoughts and that is why she had said Uncle was I any trouble to you in Mumbai Just imagine what my wife would say if she heard those words of Spoiled Brat The thought of my wife suddenly made me realize that I hadn t informed my wife that I had missed my flight and I would be arriving one day late Hey I must call my wife and tell her that I am arriving a day late I said to Spoiled Brat On hearing this Spoiled Brat said to me Uncle it is one o clock in the afternoon over here in New Zealand In India it will be very early in the morning so you can call later from my house I have good internet if you want to talk to her on Skype or Facebook Thank you Hey I forgot to ask what about your office your work I have taken an extended lunch break You must be hungry I will cook a quick meal we will have lunch then you can relax and I will go to my office finish off my work and come back early so we can go out in the evening then you can sleep at my place get up early have breakfast and I will put you on the Airport SkyBus well in time for your flight I am feeling quite awkward taking undue advantage of your hospitality especially sleeping at your place Spoiled Brat looked at me and said Don t worry Uncle my place is small but it is quite comfortable I live by myself in a small flat but there is a spare bed a sofa cum bed You live alone I asked Yes I live all by myself in a small apartment on the th floor of a high rise building the view is stunning Then how can I stay with you Why Uncle I told you there is a spare bed we will easily manage I will sleep on the sofa cum bed if it is uncomfortable for you No No It s not that How can you and me I mean just you and me how can we stay together in a small flat for the entire night wouldn t it be improper Come on Uncle this is New Zealand not India Out here in Auckland it s a modern broadminded permissive society no one bothers about these things and everyone minds their own business Still I am feeling a bit awkward I think I will prefer to stay somewhere else a hostel or backpackers dorm or something Please Uncle In Auckland you will do as I say No more discussion You are staying with me and that is final Okay if you insist But No ifs and buts Let s go my place is not very far only a minute walk Or if you are tired we can take a taxi Spoiled Brat said to me No No I prefer walking I said While we walked I dreaded to imagine how her home would be like Going by past experience of Spoiled Brat remembering the disgusting state of her filthy nauseating room in Mumbai I knew that I would have to somehow survive the next hours in a filthy stinking pigsty But as they say beggars can t be choosers I was almost broke and I was at her mercy So I walked along with her towards her house PART BETTER LIFE Same Day Auckland New Zealand Circa The weather was pleasant and it was easy to walk on the smooth uncluttered pavements minutes later we reached a high rise building where Spoiled Brat lived she entered the PIN code at the ground floor entrance the glass sliding door opened and soon we were in the lift travelling up to her th floor flat Her flat was towards the end of the corridor As Spoiled Brat opened the door I expected the worst I prepared myself to seeing a shabby dirty stinking unkempt house But when she opened the door I was stunned Her house was spick and span I was amazed at the neatness tidiness and orderliness of her home everything was organized immaculately and her house was spotlessly clean It was a small apartment flat a kitchenette at the entrance a small space a bedroom and a bathroom with minimalist yet aesthetic furniture TV Fridge Oven and the necessary gadgets everything of utility value neatly arranged in a most ingenious manner It was something like a BHK apartment we have in India but much smaller in size around square feet or so The flat reminded me of my tiny one room apartment on Curzon Road in New Delhi when I was newly married over there we had a small balcony but here there was no balcony just a large glass sliding window But as I said the flat was really spick and span nice clean light and airy and the place generated positive vibes in me Uncle did you like my house Spoiled Brat said Yes your house is wonderful I said You have kept everything so neat and clean and the view is really spectacular Yes the view is really good you get a panoramic view of Auckland harbour I was enjoying the view of the sailboats anchored in the harbour the impressive Auckland Harbour Bridge and hills beyond when I heard Spoiled Brat saying Uncle you go and freshen up in the bathroom and I will cook you a quick lunch As I walked towards the bathroom I remembered my wife s description of how Spoiled Brat had dirtied and soiled our bathroom in Mumbai and I expected the worst But when I saw her bathroom I was amazed it was probably the cleanest hygienic and most fragrant bathroom I had ever seen I washed and when I came out I saw that lunch was ready You cooked lunch so fast Yes I cook on Sundays and I keep the food frozen so I can just heat and eat Spoiled Brat opened the fridge and showed me food packets neatly wrapped in foil kept systematically in an orderly manner with a post it note on each packet indicating the dish and day of the week The kitchen was spotlessly clean with everything organized ship shape as we say in the Navy You are really well organized I said Here I have to do everything myself so I plan and organize everything properly she said I was tremendously impressed I could not believe that this was the same disorganized and shambolic girl who had stayed with us in Mumbai I had expected everything to be in shambles but she had stunned me beyond belief by her neatness tidiness and organization I was awestruck by the metamorphosis in Spoiled Brat She looked very chic and smart perfectly well groomed and pretty really Tip Top and her house was absolutely spick and span PART KIWI DREAM Same Day Auckland New Zealand Circa It was heartening to see the total transformation in Spoiled Brat her elegant Tip Top appearance her immaculate spick and span house her meticulousness it seemed that she had metamorphosed into an entirely new person It was great to eat Indian Vegetarian Food after a long time she had heated up a simple lunch of mixed vegetables and chapatti both ready to eat and frozen and quickly heated up the microwave oven The food was delicious I asked her about herself I asked her why and how she had come to New Zealand I felt I had better prospects here so I decided to come here If you want to settle down here in New Zealand it is best to use the student pathway all of us are doing that we come here on a student visa do a course in a skill shortage subject take up a job get a work visa and then try for permanent residency so we can live here indefinitely and our ultimate aim is New Zealand citizenship she said Oh so you came here as a student Yes Accountants and Finance Managers were on the skill shortage list when I decided to migrate to New Zealand I had already done my MBA Finance and had some work experience too so I came here to Auckland and did a course in Finance and Accountancy and I got a good job and so I got a work visa Now I am getting further qualifications by part time study also doing my CA course so that it becomes easy for me to get residency Residency So you intend settling down in New Zealand Is it easy for youngsters to settle down here Of course everyone who comes to New Zealand wants to permanently settle down here There are many vocations like Engineering IT Hospitality on the Skills Shortage List but the list keeps changing and you must update yourself so you can choose the proper course Tell me do you really want to stay here in New Zealand for your entire life Of course I want to live here that s why I am so desperate to get my permanent resident visa so that it will be easy for me to get New Zealand citizenship You want to realize your Kiwi Dream Ha Ha Kiwi Dream yes you can say that So you don t want to return to India No I don t think I will return to India Don t you ever feel like visiting India your hometown For holidays yes but permanently I would like to live here in New Zealand But why It s a Better Life over here A Better Life Yes a Better Life everyone who comes here wants to stay here no one wants to go back because it s a Better Life over here I wanted to ask her exactly what she meant when she said that it was a Better Life in New Zealand as compared to India Maybe she sensed what I wanted to ask her so she said Uncle I have to get back to work You relax here and in the evening we will go to a pub for drinks and dinner I will call some friends who have migrated here from India and they will all tell you how it is a Better Life over here in New Zealand About the wonderful evening in the pub the lively conversation with young diaspora who were living their Kiwi Dream I will write all about it in my blog The bright youngsters had migrated from India to New Zealand and all of them desperately wanted to settle down in New Zealand Whether it is actually a Better Life in New Zealand as compared to India that I will tell you my views later in my blog I will write about my experiences and observations in due course But now let me get back to the protagonist of this story Spoiled Brat By migrating to New Zealand whether Spoiled Brat was enjoying a Better Life I am not sure But one thing is sure By migrating to New Zealand Spoiled Brat had certainly changed for the Better Yes her passionate ambition to achieve her Kiwi Dream had transformed Spoiled Brat for the better she wasn t a Spoiled Brat anymore So Dear Reader If you have pampered spoiled brats at home you know what to do send them abroad to live on their own VIKRAM KARVE Copyright ¬© Vikram Karve If you share this post please give due credit to the author Vikram Karve Please

When I was happy with the results I then made sure there was no contaminants left in any of the ports or any intake and carb cleaner to make sure I didn‚Äôt hydraulic the engine. Final stage was too use a compressor to blow out all off the ports (when closed) and finally I ran a small magnet round the valves to collect any stray wire from the wire wheel. The hardest part of the whole process I‚Äôd say was removing the inlet manifold, there is a how to video on YouTube which shows you how to do this, luckily I‚Äôd had already removed mine to replace the injectors and install the runner flap delete kit.[img:1jcifglv] [/img:1jcifglv]"

11412,11412,"Has anyone ever noticed the little threads on the inside of the outer wall of the tip of the Sawyer cleaning filter? There are threads there and it looks like there is some sort of adapter that is meant to attach to it for a secure connection. I'm guessing it's some medical device/apparatus, as the plunger is obviously a medical plunger Sawyer has purchased in bulk to include with their various products. I'd like to find the adapter for purchase but just can't figure out what to call it in order to pull it up via Google. I've really tried everything I can think of. I have used a Sawyer Mini rigged inline in a Camelbak setup up until now, and am now using a Sawyer Micro Squeeze the same way. In the past, I took a tiny bit of Camelbak hose, jammed it over the outer wall of the plunger tip, and attached a male Camelbak Quick Disconnect fitting to the other end, so I can just pop the Sawyer off the Camelbak hose and connect it to the plunger for cleaning. On my old plunger, I never noticed these threads, but when I was setting up my Micro Squeeze today, I noticed the threads, and was able to jam a tiny bit of white silicon tubing in between the inner and outer wall of the plunger tip, where the threads are able to grab onto it and thread it down into the recess, however it's not the strongest hold. I would imagine the actual adapter that's intended to fit into that recess would probably hold much tighter. So, if anyone is aware of this fitting's existence and knows what to call it in order to Google it, I would greatly appreciate the information. I've put up three more pics in an album so everyone can see what I'm talking about. EDIT: For anyone who ends up here in pursuit of the same information I was after (thanks /u/mario-fn!), here are two examples of the exact piece I was looking for: ?hash=item25793744bf:g:YawAAOxyIPNTdl8H ?hash=item3cf9558837:g:vXAAAOSwEeFVTSHy"

3034,3034,FENPAW THISTLECLAN A BLACK TORTOISESHELL SHE CAT WITH GOLDEN EYES APPRENTICE FEMALE NINE MOONS Appearance Fenpaw commands a tall lithe frame indicative of many ThistleClan cats With her wiry legs and patchy pelt she can travel across her Clan s territory easily blending in with the low hanging pine branches She usually has a smile on her face but Fenpaw emotes freely so other cats can always count on her for an honest reaction She has bright golden eyes that are the same color as her ginger markings such as the ruff ringing her chest and the blaze on her face She has a big bushy tail and ear tufts Fenpaw s pelt is medium length and very soft She likes to groom it in certain directions it makes her feel fashionable and stylish although her mother criticizes it as being too masculine She was born a black tortoiseshell a small dark furred thing wailing in the grass Her most prominent features was the stripe in between her eyes and a single sock on her left paw The ginger around her neck that she possesses today was just a little splotch back then and then more of it began to grow in as she got older The right half of Fenpaw s chin is white until it comes to her throat and jaw mingling with the ginger before it s completely overtaken in that golden ruff Her sock became cream Barring her frontal features the rest of Fenpaw s tortoiseshell pelt is brindled No color is too clustered anywhere else Her black paws are speckled ginger and white and on her hindquarters she almost appears brown because of how the black is mixed with ginger And yes she does carry the tabby gene stripes appear on her golden neck Her blaze extends to the top of her nose making it bicolored but predominantly black Personality + assertive protective spiritual artistic pragmatic loyal outspoken blunt brazen machiavellian stubborn She is determined to make something of herself For a cat her age she is assertive She is confident in herself and does what she can to instill the same confidence in others especially if she sees a younger apprentice struggling with a lesson Once someone questions her courage she never backs down no matter how dangerous the situation Fenpaw is protective not just over younger clanmates but every cat If there s an argument Fenpaw is not afraid to step in and try to de escalate the situation She has a judicious nature and with her strong sense of fair play she will try to find the best solution for everyone involved This worked better when she was a kit cute and endearing enough to disarm any cat but after becoming an apprentice Fenpaw came to see that adults do not want kittens intruding on their arguments acting like debate police Therefore she keeps this side of her personality mostly around other apprentices or young cats stepping in to stop a cat getting picked on While she may be brave in this sense Fenpaw also dislikes getting into trouble and is unlikely to take the fall for another cat If a cat is hinting or hiding something Fenpaw might just bluntly say it She has trouble keeping her true feelings hidden Her sharp tongue might be her downfall She s a sucker for a pretty face If there s a beautiful she cat around she will be there to remark on it and if you are the sort to compete for the girl s heart she never passes up a friendly wager Fenpaw loves to woo flirt and be romantic She has a very spiritual side and faith in StarClan She says that there are omens in every event and action that StarClan tries to speak and we just need to listen She believes in superstitions and intuitions perhaps from spending her childhood listening to the elders Their legends and stories inspired her to have a adventurous view of the world many of them she has memorized completely She is a kitty of the arts To her the legends of the past must never be forgotten and she is frequently ridiculed out of earshot by other ThistleClanners for beliefs they consider outdated weird and childish She makes songs out of the tales the elders tell Fenpaw has a good sense of logic She is loyal and committed to ThistleClan but she listens to what other cats have to say if it will improve her Clan as well She knows the Warrior Code and knows that one day she may fight the other Clans in battle but deep down she d rather kill someone in their sleep than fight fair Taking advantage of the enemy s disadvantage is more important than honor Her body s duel against bellyache gave her a grave understanding of what things like deathberries and crowfood could do to a cat History Fenkit s parents found companionship as fox attacks rocked ThistleClan They came across each other in the chaos and became close in their shared goal for survival Living in the tunnels put the whole clan in closer proximity than before Her parents often found themselves repairing the same parts of camp or coming across each other doing the same tasks in the territory They courted and were quite romantic between each other for many moons but waited until things were more stable in ThistleClan before starting their family Deaths were unfortunately common like the devastating loss of the clan s deputy from greencough then Yarrowfrost passing away a season later followed by Froststar s sickness Once ThistleClan s leadership stabilized Fenkit s parents announced the pregnancy to the Clan and soon three kittens were born They named their children Fenkit Brindlekit and Goldenkit Brindlekit was a tortie like her while Goldenkit was a ginger tabby tom They played often while in the nest but Fenkit was first to peer over the pine needle walls and take in the sights of the nursery Her eyes met an entire arena filled with other kittens and big queens lounging around protectively Fenkit s fur puffed up and her mother s rough tongue groomed it down to soothe her These are your clanmates dearest All the stories I have told you about your clan Here they are Some of these kits are your age so make friends with them Fenkit was nudged to the edge of the nest There were many eyes on her as she leapt to the nursery floor nose sniffing the ground She occupied herself with smelling the whole place suspiciously taking slow steps even as her mother laughingly introduced the nest occupants she passed When she came to one nest marked by long fluffy hair her mother quickly called her back To approach that white nest was taboo Her parents said a curse had afflicted that one Fenkit was told to stay away She was forbidden from leaving camp too so if she wasn t by their home nest her time was spent in the elders den She listened to their stories every day and learned from their grizzled assertiveness toward and compassion over their younger clanmates She grew up playing with pine needles and grass Goldenkit s fur was always messy from rolling around and Brindlekit and Fenkit smelled like sap The whole landscape reeked of it but their mother complained the most since she groomed the three of them everyday Thus began the enforcement of self grooming and their mother no longer demanded they spend the night in her nest One night Brindlekit wanted to watch the night sky She crawled out of the pile waking up Fenkit who peered over the side after her Brindlekit sat at the nursery exit for a long time Fenkit started to nod off again She wasn t sure how long she fell asleep but the next time she opened her eyes a lump shaped like Brindlekit was still at the doorway with the longest shadow she d ever seen The shadow moved and the moonlight coming through the entryway fell upon a shiny frightening eye She mewled loudly in fear crying Mama Her mother awoke instantly at the sound of her kit s alarm It s Brindlekit Fenkit pointed at the long writhing shadow at the den way A snake Her mother s yowl alerted the other queens Fenkit watched her mother spring from the nest and gallop at the scary thing It started moving and that was when Fenkit realized Brindlekit was nowhere to be seen The sounds of battle hissing from both cats and snake made her retreat to the bottom of the nest curling up around Goldenkit trembling together In the morning when they awoke and Brindlekit was still not there their mother tearily informed them that their sister was with StarClan StarClan It was a place in the skies a home for all cats of the past The elders told stories where the ancestors guided the main characters and special cats within their own clan like the Medicine Cat who were chosen to receive direct visions Now it was home to her sister After that Goldenkit and Fenkit became closer They formed a buddy system to keep each other safe through their kithood Goldenkit was more rambunctious and adventurous than his sister but Fenkit was not far behind and could always be goaded into following him around if only to watch his back The two were eager playmates as well as a rapt audience for elders tales Fenkit knew all the words by heart As she grew older and stronger she earned her apprentice suffix and was granted a mentor who would hone her skills She was thrilled to make something of herself and become a warrior of ThistleClan Wandering the fields in search of prey and good smells was her favorite pasttime as she usually spent her free time singing Brindlekit s death was far behind her it affected her parents more and the fear of predators did little to deter Fenpaw from enjoying herself in ThistleClan s territory With time and her mentor s training she knew she d be strong enough to defend herself and others She was popular in the apprentice s den thanks to her friendly yet outspoken demeanor While she and Goldenpaw were thick as thieves still the two of them were starting to notice she cats for their looks even competing for hearts in some cases Fenpaw liked hanging out with as many she cats as possible Of course her mentor disapproved mainly because the apprentice was a straight up sucker when it came to a pretty face Sometimes it was good to train through a distraction but mostly her behavior was frustrating When combined with her penchant for plopping herself into adult arguments like a peanut gallery the young shecat could be obnoxious On one of these occasions her mentor lost temper and ordered Fenpaw to return to camp They were patrolling the bog with another mentor apprentice pair and the two mentors had been discussing the last Gathering heatedly between themselves Fenpaw left her denmate and the two warriors heading in the direction of camp at first and then veering north until she felt thorns underfoot No predators ran by but Fenpaw saw a dead raccoon splayed out She smelled opossum too and saw it by the berry bushes dead too Free prey Fenpaw thought unable to believe her luck She d hunted early in the patrol but had buried it with the expectation that she d be back to get it She was hungry She pounced on the raccoon and played with it using its forepaw as a chewtoy It was rubbery to the touch wobbling in place Feeling bold she lunged and bit down into the skin A rush of putrescent hot air spilled into her mouth and sinus and she tasted flesh that may as well have been poison She d later be told that the vile stuff was called crowfood Fenpaw gagged Staggering Fenpaw ran toward camp and collapsed along the way Someone must have came across her in the field When she awoke she was in Ratwhisker s den coming to just to vomit and a paw turned her head aside so she would not aspirate it A wet ball of moss was pushed to her snout and she licked gratefully but it felt like all her strength had been sapped from her She tried to take a sniff to figure out where she was but instead the nausea returned and she closed her eyes again to ward it away The second time her eyes opened halfway and a white blur hovered over her She saw strange eyes peer at her and in her incoherence she wondered who was on the other side of that bush peeking back But they did not speak and neither did Fenpaw Paws manipulated her head position her jaws her throat massaging all these parts of her She could hardly tell how much time had passed but she was grateful for the bitter taste of the medicine cat s herbs Sometimes when the poppy wore off her eyes would crack open and she would see a cat chewing roots and prey into a pulp When he approached her with it she took it gratefully swallowing small bites When she finally could open her eyes again for longer than a few minutes Fenpaw was ravenous and had lost weight in the interim Only Goldenpaw and her parents were allowed to enter as a group and visit her but it was determined that Fenpaw would make a full recovery so they did not worry much over her Now that she was awake she would remain in the medicine cat den for a few days just until her bellyache passed and everything stabilized She even felt well enough to practice singing scales Let me guess chervil and watermint she asked Ratwhisker on her last day She d memorized them after hearing him prescribe them enough times It d been the older tom who had nursed her back to health so she felt like she owed him a life debt or at the very least considered him a friend There s something special to be said about the silent bond shared between the sick and the caretakers Her life had been in his paws This is a cat who deserves my protection the most she thought It felt good to be back in action after that Fenpaw gained some restraint with her debate moderating and made up with her mentor She worked hard and stayed focused in all of her fighting lessons Her hunts were always dedicated to StarClan and she gave her biggest hunts to Ratwhisker second biggest to her mother and the other queens She was three moons into this apprenticeship schtick and she felt this was all going great The warrior ancestors had guided her paws true this far she wasn t about to lose hope in them no matter what the older cats gossiped about

4914,4914,"For those who have been told that they should calibrate their Sony with local dimming off, I present you with what that does to the colors and gamma when you turn local dimming on after the fact. I posted a white screen shifting to green hue on the main X900F thread a few months back. Below is a YouTube video I just made showing my 0.16dE calibration shifting and altering hue and color, when local dimming is enabled, at any level. Ignore the contrast shifting, and pay attention to the 8 bit levels of the face shifting location and hue. As could be seen in my previous post with the picture of the crazy gamma RGB curve when LD is turned on, this is what it looks like to the human eye. Because local dimming alters the color at different levels of brightness, and objects being affected by local dimming will change brightness levels, and correspondingly change the color values, you get shades that are very incorrect being produced. As the forehead spot is brightened by LD, it is moved to the next gamma step on the 10 point, and because a calibrated TV will have different 10 point adjustment values, the TV will display the wrong 10 point RGB for the wrong now out of alignment brightness. This should be less of an issue with a 2 point alignment, because although you won't get as accurate a gamma, or a gamma of your choosing, the 10 point values are fixed all the same, so the shifting in hues should not occur. See video , magenta and mustard swapping locations and moving across the face. [ame] [/ame]"
1718,1718,"I would advise against that if you know the gaskets have not been changed in a long time (or ever considering it's an 05). If they're in poor shape seafoam will eat them up and you'll be replacing the head gaskets/valve cover gaskets and possibly more. I know this isn't the effect it advertises for high mileage vehicles, but it happens from time to time. The oil additive I always suggest is Engine Restore in the silver can with a stop sign symbol, looks like an old timey can. Just pour into your oil and within a minute or two it will quiet down most engines. If that doesn't work then you've got an issue you need to look further into."

1350,1350,Sooo i was a little disappointed in these brushes only because theres really only that are even usable The eyeshadow brushes are too stiff and small to do eyeshadow with and the spot corrector does not allow adequate filling But the two larger brushes and the palm brush are GREAT for applying foundation and blending afterwards Thats what i mainly use them for so if youre looking into these brushes i suggest just buying the two bigger ones and saving some major bucks
3104,3104,Theresa May asks Queen s permission to form government May is said to have agreed an informal coalition with DUP Tories failed to win majority resulting in hung parliament in the UK general election Corbyn says Labour is willing to work with smaller parties Theresa May met with the Queen to request her permission to form a government Speaking outside Downing Street she confirmed I will now form a government A government that can provide certainty and lead Britain forward Getty Advertisement Continue Reading Below She added What the country needs now more than ever is certainty Having secured the largest number of votes and greatest number of seats in the general election it is clear the Conservatives and Unionist party has the legitimacy to provide that Extensive talks overnight with the Democratic Unionists Party are said to have resulted in a sort of informal coalition This would mean rather than an official coalition such as that between the Tories and Lib Dems in May would run a small working majority of MPs in the Commons between them with the DUP agreeing to back her in parliament We would consider a supply and confidence arrangement to make sure Theresa May would have sufficient support to keep her in government one DUP MP told Sky News Her gamble in calling a snap election appeared to have backfired in the early hours of Friday morning as the exit poll prediction that the Conservative Party could lose its majority was confirmed Experts say this resulting hung parliament will lead to a period of political uncertainty and could throw Brexit negotiations due to start June into disarray AP The poll count saw the Conservatives get of the seats in Parliament down from while the Labour Party won up from Advertisement Continue Reading Below For Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn who campaigned on leadership for the many not the few the results highlighted an incredible turn around Written off by many pollsters Labour surged in the final weeks of the campaign and the party drew strong support from young people who are said to have voted in bigger than expected numbers in this election Getty Corbyn has said Labour is willing to form alliances with other smaller parties but even if they joined forces with the SNP Lib Dems Green Party and Plaid Cymru it would only reach seats They would need This has put pressure on May to resign but she has confirmed this is not on her agenda As she was re elected to her Maidenhead seat she said The country needs a period of stability and whatever the results are the Conservative Party will ensure we fulfill our duty in ensuring that stability so that we can all as one country go forward together If you have just woken forget that strong stable government Britain s voted for a hung parliament PM s survival in doubt Nick Robinson June If the poll is anything like accurate this is completely catastrophic for the Conservatives and for Theresa May former Conservative Treasury chief George Osborne said on ITV Clearly if she s got a worse result than two years ago and is almost unable to form a government then she I doubt will survive in the long term as Conservative Party leader Ed Balls a former Labour Treasury chief said it would hurt May s negotiating position with Europe I do not see how she can be a strong and credible figure now to lead these negotiations he said Corbyn said the result was a clear sign that voters have rejected Conservative austerity Speaking after being re elected to his Islington North seat Corbyn said May should go and make way for a government that is truly representative of all the people of this country The result was also bad news for the Scottish National Party which had lost about of its seats by early on Friday Among the casualties was Alex Salmond a former first minister of Scotland and one of the party s highest profile lawmakers

6220,6220,"FitrahSoaps Rose & Lavender Lotion Bars Rose has a variety of vitamins, antioxidants, and minerals and its oil are fantastic for tackling dry skin. It also offers astringent properties, making it an excellent combatant of acne, redness, and inflammation. Products made with rosehip seed oil are full of anti-aging properties as well as Vitamins A, C, D, and E, which help minimize wrinkles and fine lines. Why is a Lotion Bar Better? Why is the lotion bar better, you ask?? Here are three reasons. 1. No plastic bottle/ Environmental Footprint Because the lotion is solid, there is no need to package lotion in a plastic bottle. Also with natural ingredients, the process for creating a lotion bar is low impact. Yay for Planet Earth. 2. Use IN the shower/ Efficiency of Application and Increased Moisturizing The best time to apply moisturizer is when your pores are open, either in the shower/bath, or just out of the shower/bath. This allows the lotion to deeply penetrate skin as well as seal and protect skin throughout the day. 3. Purity/No Fillers Lotion bars have a reputation for being a health-conscious choice because they are free from the potentially hazardous chemicals found in commercial lotion products, such as phthalates, parabens, formaldehyde, para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), ethanolamines and petroleum. How to Use a Lotion Bar Using a lotion bar is easy; just take the lotion bar into hands and warm it with body heat, this will melt a small portion of the bar. One then can either rub the lotion onto the body part that needs moisturizing, or get enough in hands to put lotion bar down and use hands to cover skin. Lotion bars are especially effective in the shower, or right out of the shower when pores are open. How long will a Lotion Bar last? One Lotion Bar will last approximately eight to ten uses depending on how vigorously you rub and for how long. Please keep in well drained soap dish and use care when stepp"

1465,1465,Globetrotting American comedian author and occasional burlesque dancer Lynn Ruth Miller is very pissed off at being forced into a total lockdown in London She has written about her recent trips in this blog Search for her name And she was due to perform in Europe Scandinavia the Far East Australia and North America in upcoming months but has had to cancel Now she is VERY annoyed She explains why in this open letter plea to Westminster which she rounds off with a second song In there are more people over the age of than there are under the age of a ratio that has never occurred before according to Deutsche Bank and they should know they are German And now the UK government has kept all of us over confined to our homes in a lockdown That is blatant ageism at its worst Why Because the powers that control us are looking at everyone through the wrong lens They are evaluating each of us on the basis of their own preconceptions about age instead of accessing the quality of our immune systems It turns out that the older you are the more resilient you are to illness The current coronavirus pandemic has actually affected men aged disproportionately along with people who have compromised immune systems But that isn t me And I am stuck in the house Let s face it I am old very old When Google tells me it will take me ten minutes to walk someplace it always takes me twenty If I would dare to drive a car I would never go over mph In a car I would keep the turn signal the indicator signal on just in case I have to make a right turn I can t say Peter Piper Picked a Peck of Pickled Peppers any more I look like an un pressed rag and I have more hair on my chin than my foo foo But I am healthy filled with energy and I have an exciting life or I did until I was told that just because I am old I need to get someone else to do my shopping and I damn well better not get on a bus For some people over this is not a hardship They live in homes with other people But I am alone no partner no children no pet to care for just me The government now allows me one solitary walk a day and no one to hug And that is endangering my psychological well being Now I respect rules I do not want to infect anyone and I do not want to be infected I stand meters away from people when I walk and I cover my mouth when I cough But when I see some year old guy in a Zimmer frame sailing off to Sainsbury s I can t help but think Why can t I go there too and not at am when not even the birds are awake Psychology today says that without the boost of oxytocin that comes with physical touch elderly individuals may end up feeling more stressed and their physical health may suffer In fact people who are affection deprived are less happy more lonely more likely to experience depression and stress and in general in worse health They have less social support and lower relationship satisfaction I ll bet you legislators never thought of that when you told us to stay home did you So for the sake of my well being and my desperate need for a cuddle I suggest everyone over should be awarded a puppy and a loving visitor In my case I would prefer a toy boy You know someone in his s that can still think at best At the very least I want him to have a couple of teeth left Think about that all you legislators while you are giving away money to small businesses and independent workers Money helps but when you cannot leave the house to spend it a hug can be worth ten visits to a psychiatrist You just might save even more lives that way than you are now by locking us in our living rooms

157,157,It was a glorious Sydney morning in early March when I m scheduled to meet Marie and Annica Eklund aka the BOLON sisters at the first Australian showroom for the much loved Swedish brand If you know anything about Marie and Annica you d know these ladies are absolutely always dressed to kill I mean holy shit kind of outfits So naturally I make sure I wash my hair that morning and put on my good dress however it was clear from the outset that I might as well have turned up in my daggy PJs because the sisters are looking freaking ridiculous in their fashion forward get up Well at least I tried Of course there s so much more to Annica and Marie than their exciting fashion choices These women have been at the helm of BOLON for the past years and have singlehandedly transformed the company from a family business into an internationally renowned design brand This is entirely not surprising as from the moment we meet their candid nature vibrant energy genuine curiosity disarming charm and generosity of spirit are evident every step of the way the sorts of qualities all good leaders ought to possess I guess you could say I fell in love with them a little during our morning spent inside the light filled BOLON Sydney showroom chatting about our shared love of design the importance of having a clear vision making mistakes stepping outside one s comfort zone and what it takes to stay relevant in the era of digital overwhelm Read on for a short extract from our conversation And if you re in Sydney I suggest you get yourself to BOLON showroom at Oxford Street Paddington Once the COVID pandemic is over of course In the meantime I have no doubt The Andrews Group BOLON s exclusive Australian partner will be happy to assist with your enquiry See more from BOLON on Yellowtrace here Fun and frivolity during the loveliest morning spent with these two amazing women Marie BOLON is a lifestyle with unique attributes Also in at the entrance of the showroom is this image of BOLON s latest campaign photographed by Annica She explained how complex the creation process was for example this particular image was stitched using individually shot frames Since taking over BOLON you have really built a sense of desirability glamour and luxury around the brand The idea of hospitality is also very important to you with your boutique hotel on a vineyard in northern Italy and two guesthouses in Sweden How have these ideas of hospitality food and community been translated into your new Sydney showroom For us BOLON is more than the products as we mentioned before Hospitality is in our DNA that s why we run Villa la Madonna in Piemonte and have our guesthouses in Ulricehamn Without the hospitality part BOLON wouldn t be the same The showroom in Sydney will have the same look and feel as any of our other global showrooms around the world but of course with its own identity It s important that we show Australia what BOLON is all about And we have the best confidence that The Andrews Group will run the place and show visitors the family side of BOLON They also have the high end service at the top of their mind we couldn t be prouder to finally have a BOLON showroom in Australia Annica and Marie Eklund of BOLON The dark transitional space inside the BOLON Sydney Showroom bridges the entrance with the light and bright back room where the kitchen and most of the samples are located What do you feel is the most challenging part of being a part of the design industry today And equally what do you think are the opportunities If you could change one thing about the design industry what would it be It is important that the design industry comes together that we dare to collaborate between brands in order to for example solve the sustainability issue that is so important for the future The business will be stronger if we dare to collaborate The possibilities with new technology and new research are endless we look forward to new exciting and durable materials And we also think that design objects in the future will need to consist of more functions in one product so people can use them for more than just one thing for a lifetime Smarter objects that is developed for how people live and exist is something that needs to be done We can t only produce new objects in the future we need the design industry to become more sustainable in a smart way The coolest campaign imagery created by Annica for BOLON s latest Art of Performance collection launched at Stockholm Furniture Fair in February See more here What excites you about your work and what are some of your methods to stay motivated focused and expressive Annica That we are able to continue to create an interesting business inspiring injections to our brand by working with

Learning from them mistakes mean you dare to act Marie To start working at BOLON it was never my intention I started only to help out for a while I had a degree in fashion design but it was fantastic

1517,1517,Hi i know what you are going through as i am going through the same as well as bringing up my children as a single dad See if this rings any bells for you I got diabetes in aged and my parents were told that if i got through the next hours i would pull through which i did they gave my parents a orange to practice giving injections on and these were the day of glass injection and massive needles I had a few up and downs in and out of hospital but the problems started when i was I went to get my eyes checked and was told that i needed to go to hospital i just thought he may want a doctor to check them so off i went I was seen by the doctor who said that i needed laser treatment on both eyes he said it was like a pin prick I went only to find out it was nothing like he said and was coming out after it with a headache and had to wear sunglasses even if it was raining outside This went on for about six months and the last few session were done with me a sleep i think i still hold the record for most laser treatment Then one night i was out i i could not see anything out of my left eye i went home and asked my dad could he see anything he said no so the next day i still could not see so i went to a and e and the doctor told me a tiny blood vessel has burst behind the eye and that s why i could not see and sent me to the eye Hospital at Sunderland this was am on a Monday morning i was seen by one doctor then another and about pm a doctor said come down here to the ward while i have a look He had a look and said you will be first on the list for tomorrow i said for what he said a operation i looked at my dad with the eye i could see out of and he was as shocked as i was So the next morning i got up had a pre med and the doctor came and said it should take about mins to do hours later i was back on the ward looking like long John silver They said you have to try and lie down with your face in the pillow i could not do it but i needed to go to the toilet when a nurse came running down asking what was i doing out of bed i tried to say i was going to the toilet but vomit came up instead all over the nurse The next day they took the patch off and asked what i could see i said the same as i could before nothing i was sent home with some tablets which they hoped would take the blood away So a week later i went back only to be told that next week they were going to do the op again in the end i had three ops on the left eye and two on the right eye I had just got over all that was just gone and i was told that i needed to see a renal doctor who told me that i would need a kidney transplant by the time i was i walked out of there and broke down in tears I was having trouble at my local hospital team which included me telling one doctor that if he kept wagging his finger in my face that i was going to put him through the window I hit and apart from ops on my hands and elbow m renal function was around I was told that they would give me a insulin pump if i went on a day DAFNE course i said what do you think i have been doing for the past years so i said no and they said no So i was due a meeting with the hospital management but a couple of days before i was asked would i agree to a half day course i said yes and got my pump in November and was still no further forward so i looked on the internet and found a doctor at Newcastle who did pumps and was also part of the transplant team so i went to see him and he had been sent A4 sheet of paper with what was wrong I had thick files so i had to go back every week it took him weeks to sort the pump out but now the problem was that the renal team were not sending him any letters I change all my care to the Freeman hospital and it was the best thing i ever did i was when i was put on the transplant list for a pancreas and kidney Then on April the th at am i had a call asking could i get to the Freeman as there was a possible match for me i went through all the checks and was told that it would be pm then pm then midnight i could hear the the the man coming to get me just before am on the th my sons birthday i had been calm all day and now i was ready to be put to sleep It was midday when i woke up in the HDU with more thing sticking out of my body the transplant was a done and it was working i spent the next months in and out of hospital which put a lot of strain on my children and parents At the start of i was in so much pain that they took me back in to hospital and found out that my whole body had nerve damage which was there for life so after trying different painkillers and going to pain management the pain was getting no worse in may of that year i went from kg to kg in a week and was not eating so back to hospital where test showed that my bladder could hold over pints without needing the toilet so i was given catheters to use and the doctor who did the op said they had cut some nerves away from the bladder during the op and then they found out that there was nerve damage to the bowel as well and for the last years i have been under different mental health teams Sometimes i could scream or cry at what diabetes has done to me and my family but also what my children have had to see and how well they have coped with it i am so proud of them What the future holds i do not know but if my children who have not seen there mother for years can keep going on then i will keep fighting to my last breath We as a family have good days and bad days but no matter what i cherish everyday that i see them smile or do well at school I will try my best to bring them up to be thankful for what they have and always to treat people with respect and to try there best at everything they do
12524,12524,how do you do fellow kids THE SOMETTIMES WASPISH REDHEAD MUSTERED AN outright grin as the absolutely gargantuan horned kid offered him a fine collection of a hairclips bobby pins and clips of all sorts welcoming the smaller teen to use as much as he needed Thanks man Kenji said brightly selecting one metal clip before returning the rest He went to the window away from the group to use the reflection to fix his hair He didn t want to look like a dweeb with how he pinned his hair after all he had to pin it properly Though he had removed himself from the group it was difficult to miss the apparently mentally challenged girl s salutations to the group Kenji turned marginally to regard the purple haired weirdo Ho kay Weird English kid with terri bad Japanese At least they d have some entertainment The redhead returned to fixing his hair It was about the time that Kenji finished gathering his bangs and secured them in the clip atop his head to the rest of his hair that he felt a presence for lack of a better word over his shoulder An unfamiliar and frankly uninvited hand found Kenji s shoulder and instinctively the teen dropped his shoulder going tense and whirling to face the offender his eyes almost serpentine >> We talk after class Don t fucking touch me Kenji hissed back It was the midget with the nerd glasses Hey doesn t this seem familiar As Kenji stood with his back to the window glowering at the back of the other boy s head it finally dawned on him I know him Nerd glasses Dark skin Short as Kenji well shorter now and twice as round It s that asshole from the arcade Ironic how all it took was another uninvited touch to jog his memory Kenji waited until the other boy was seated before venturing to his own desk His face was hot His hands were shaking And he couldn t stop glancing at the back of Nerd Glasses s head yes that was his name now Kenji could hear his heart beating in his ears Mosa said no fights Mosa said no fights Mosa said no fights Why else did someone meet after class except to fight Day one of classes and someone already wanted to fight The teen dropped his gaze towards his desk clenching his fists Mosa said no fights Kenji was so tunnel visioned on the apparent conflict at hand he missed the teacher s warm greeting altogether as well as the boisterous interjection of yet another mentally impaired eccentric foreigner He clenched his fists so tightly that his nails made little crescents in his palms Mosa said no fights Maybe I could switch classes The mountainous teen behind Kenji introduced himself as Burabura Buruburu Then Misako Suzuki then Rei Ledo Rei s boisterous introduction finally jarred Kenji from his thoughts earning a somewhat confused glance from the red haired teen Oh were they introducing themselves Kenji rubbed his nose with the back of his sleeve His face was still hot The redhead decided that Rei seemed alright Particularly given his gutsy introduction Kenji had tuned in just in time for the new bane of his existence to speak and he leaned over in his seat to pull a fresh unused comp book from his backpack trying to make a show of not listening to Nerd Glasses It didn t work His name was Edward Eckles from America and he was just as much of a stick up the ass as Kenji had assumed from the first time he d met him He might have warranted a slight side eye from the teen as he demonstrated his quirk and then it was back to looking dispassionately and pointedly at the comp book Kenji wrote his name on the cover in ballpoint pen then went over it a few times to give it a jagged badass look Sure Edward said he wanted to get along with everyone and be a true hero but true heroes didn t pick fights on the first day of class now did they This dude was full of shit A pregnant silence followed Kenji lifted his gaze from his masterpiece towards the patiently awaiting face of his teacher which was sweeping the classroom Fuck what was the teacher s name again Did everyone already introduce themselves Kenji rose awkwardly from his seat his chair squawking against the tile His face was still red though now from apparent embarrassment His comp book was in his hand Uh Kenji glanced around the room A number of eyes were on him He cleared his throat Something to get their attention something cool An idea struck him and it was like a switch had flipped The redhead broke into a run towards the front of the room and when he was within a meter of the front wall he leapt free hand and foot first Sticky sleeves formed over his hand and foot and as he made contact he held himself tight The teen was apparently suspended by nothing at all Crouched against the wall he turned to face his peers Belatedly he also stuck his comp book to the wall to show that he wasn t just another wallcrawler Kenji Murano he said simply Hero name Slapdash Charles had explained the irony of the name to him but for posterity s sake the teen kept it I manipulate friction Kenji leapt from the wall disengaging the sticky discs His cheeky grin faded into something more of a smirk His eyes went calculating And I m here cuz uh he trailed How seriously did he want to take this How much did he want to say His eyes flitted towards Edward unable to avoid him from this angle God that dude made it hard to think uh His gaze cut towards the rest of the class Most people rely on their parents for shi stuff when they re younger But if your parents are villains like legit villains you turn to heroes instead Kenji staggered through a verbal explanation It didn t take any stretch of the imagination to figure out who really had villains for parents even if Kenji hadn t overtly said it Heroes are like always there when people need them the most and strong and cool and kind and I want to be like that too Okay so he kinda borrowed the script from when Mosa had asked him that same question And it wasn t the most articulate answer But for someone as thoughtless as Kenji it was about the most thoughtful answer you could wrench from him So yeah The teen walked casually back to his seat rather than using slippery discs to slide because he worried the nerves would make him fall on his ass He d left his comp book stuck to the wall in his absentmindedness ft Michi Yamazaki and the rest of class A quirk friction manip d rank mobility range strength f rank street

4133,4133,Username The Grimster Wrestler Name Solomon Graham Nickname s The Prince Of Prince Edward Island Date of Birth Hometown Hamilton Ontario Canada Billed From Charlottetown Prince Edward Island Canada Height Weight lbs Photobase Daniel Makabe Pro Debut Handedness Right Ring Attire His attire scheme is similar to Jerry The King Lawler s in the sense that he has a one strap singlet overtop of a pair of tights The singlet is black while the tights are metallic gold His boots are black and he wears knee pads underneath the tights His right hand and wrist and left wrist are wrapped in white Hockey tape He used to wear a grey shirt to cover up his imperfections but since getting his body into a buffer shape he doesn t need that anymore Moveset Punch Is always told to open the fist Kick Armbar Legbar Clutches opponents leg and attempts to bend it in a way where the bone pops Waistlock Full Nelson Eye Poke Eye Rake Back Rake Hair Pull Will sometimes also punch his opponent while pulling their hair given they re facing the right way and are in the right position Headlock Chinlock Hammerlock Bear Hug Clutch Doesn t actually do the Bear Hug as he never lifts his opponent off the ground in an attempt to make them pass out but instead it s more in an attempt to take them to the ground He may sometimes lift them over his head but it s usually an attempt to slam them down onto the mat hard Any kind of chop though his chop of choice is a standard chop with the opponent propped up in the corner After the chop he ll usually follow through and land a back elbow for his opponent s troubles Stiff Daniel Bryan esque kicks to the chest of an opponent who s down on their knees Knee Strike to the head or chest Flatliner w DDT Head Cradle adapted from his best friend Eddie Evans Greco Roman Knuckle Lock OTHER TACTICS HE UTILIZES Will often hold opponents back with his hand on their foreheads all the while turning his attention to other things around him and treating his opponent as both non threatening and not worth his time and energy For example he may Talk to the ref Take the time to talk up the FWA or any other fed he s currently part of All of these are done in an attempt to make the opponent feel small This tactic is only done when Graham is facing a smaller shorter opponent When he s had enough and is getting bored he ll draw back and smack em right in the face Will lay down on the mat offering a Free Pinfall Only Comedy Jobber characters actually fall for it though and every time Graham locks them in some kind of hold whether it be his family s arm bar or something else Also if anyone tries a diving attack while Graham is laying on the mat Graham will move out of the way and take advantage right after they come crashing down Will sometimes walk right up to the opponent and hug them This leaves the opponent both frustrated and too confused to act Will sometimes cut a promo mid match though this is a very rare occurrence He treats his opponents as non threatening no matter the size Often he ll slap his opponent in the face or insult their style This really only applies high flyers and comedy wrestlers with him calling them Spotmonkeys who shit on the business or telling them Funny don t draw money asshole He ll sometimes spit in their eye to start the match off as it gives him an advantage and leaves them open to attacks Signature Moves Graham Family Armbreaker A move that was once banned all across Canada Essentially it is a Fujiwara Armbar where Graham brings the arm back in a Hammerlock position and wrenches it in bringing his own arm between the opponent s arm and back bringing it back up and attempting to break the shoulder End Of The Line Million Dollar Dream A move that was practiced by his grandfather taught to his father and uncles and passed down to the third generation of Grahams and other students of the Graham Academy as a means of keeping the legacy alive and well Finisher s

strip attached to him around the knuckle before driving his right hand directly into his open left hand and walking to the ring on the way stopping to taunt the fans and give them shit He climbs the ring apron and wipes his feet on the apron He then steps into the ring gets into his corner and waits for his opponent Championship Entrance Description Majesty hits and after the short intro out from

Biography He is the son of Canadian wrestling legend Late Night Allen Graham as well as grandson of Canadian American wrestling icon Lyle Graham Sr He trained alongside his siblings and cousins the only ones worth noting being Ryan Graham of AXW fame and Emily Graham of CHAMP and GHWA fame He graduated at age and went on to become a staple of Canadian wrestling much like his father and grandfather before him He soon branched out becoming well known in New York New Jersey Pennsylvania and the surrounding states he s even been to Italy to wrestle and lived there for a brief period with his boyfriend While he hasn t won many championships he has a reputation of brutality in the ring often pushing his opponent to the absolute limit before either beating them or realizing he can t and accepting his fate He is in EWS because of his uncle Jamie Zero who recommended him to management They saw the excellent qualities in him signed him to a contract and then properly wasted his talent by making him a joke He has been royally pissed off ever since those days and longs to make EWS and others under their umbrella pay and realize their mistake He even opened his own company and signed two former EWS World champions one of which is also a former x AXW Champion as well as some other former AXW talents to show what he was capable of Other Graham is openly bisexual though it s not talked about or mentioned very often Graham chose the Low Blow as his finisher because he feels it will help ingrain in the minds of the fans that he is a heel and will help distinguish him from other heels on the roster He feels that unlike him most heels these days don t really know how to be proper heels aside from a select few of course He s also a known fan of video games comics and internet culture and will sometimes reference those in promos as well This has been a well kept secret since he got into the wrestling business but he has High Functioning Autism which is really helpful to him as a booker since the gears in his head never stop turning

9231,9231,"Yeah priority number one is to get to cp 160 then your gear will no longer degrade. Try to get all class passives and weapon passives that you use. For higher dps 2 hander unfortunately is not that viable. If i were you, once i hit 160 i'd farm out stormfist as a monster set (2x medium both divines if possie) for body set get yourself leviathan (drops in crypts of hearts 1&2) 5x medium all divines if possible and for weapons and jewellery I'd use strength of the automation set(drops in barkshade caverns 1&2) 2x rings 1x necklace 2x dagger or 1x 2handed & bow for backbar. If you cannot get these can you can also ask for crafted set like twice born star is nice or night mothers gaze. Stamplar sustain is hard so dont use velidreth as monster set, not worth it. Go stormfist for the recovery. As for bars if you have a bow for backbar something like this is nice to have 1. Endless hail 2. Razor caltrops 3. Poison injection 4. Rearming trap/channeled acceleration 5. Channeled focus stamina morph Ulti: Crescent sweep For frontbar 1. Jabs 2. Crushing weapon/ blood craze 3. Power of the light 4. Executioner on 2 handed / steel tornado 5. Forward momentum/ vigor Ulti: flawless dawnbreaker Use action duration reminder addon. The thing that is going to double your dps even on low level is keeping your dots up. Prebuff before a fight meaning put forward momentum on and channeled acceleration( if you have it) and channeled focus stamina morph Start on bow bar Endless hail light attak caltrops light attak poison injection light attak beast trap light attack Swap bars use jabs in trashfights On single target fights Use power of the light light attack spamm crushing weapon with light attacks if you have a 2 hander unless do it with bloodcraze use executioner below 50% hp. Rest is keeping it all up. This isnt a perfect buils but it helps you get started and will likely serve you for a while."

way up to the lake Jeff stopped and bought groceries but when he arrived at the inn they informed him his room was not ready He said he d come back in a few hours and gave the attendant his cell phone

√©√©n en speelde Fauci een smerige rol in deze During the controversy over XMRV and its relation to diseases such as ME CFS and autism we had no fiercer critic that Kuan Teh Jeang the editor in chief of Retrovirology and second in command to Tony Fauci at the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases At first we were puzzled by Teh Jeang s violent reaction to our work Frank Ruscetti and I had worked with Teh Jeang in the early days of HIV research and HTLV human T cell leukemia virus the first human disease causing retrovirus Teh Jeang was an intelligent charismatic little man always looking for ways to increase the participation of minorities in the biological sciences which up until that time had mainly been the province of white men Teh Jeang was a top notch scientist However on December Teh Jeang took the unusual step ofallowing the simultaneous publication of six negative articles about our XMRV research as editor of the journal Retrovirology I say it was unusual because Frank had talked to several of the reviewers of the papers who told us they had recommended the papers not be published because of significant flaws None passed peer review One of the peer reviewers told Frank that in response to these criticisms Teh Jeang admitted the papers in and of themselves were not up to the proper scientific standard for publication but together they make a point and they stand In a later editorial from August of Teh Jeang seemed to take an almost ghoulish delight in the attack he launched on XMRV In this respect a significant example can be drawn from the six Retrovirology papers published in December that were the first to pivotally correct the then held belief that XMRV was an etiological cause of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome CFS In that instance Retrovirology s Open Access format was particularly instrumental in permitting interested individuals who were not career scientists to freely rapidly and fully access those paradigm changing peer reviewed publications 5 You d think he was tracking down a murderer with the glee in which he attacked findings barely a year old but that had been vetted by the highest levels of the public health establishment in July of As I read that section of the editorial what it said to me is I can hoodwink other health professionals not familiar with viruses to believe this nonsense because they don t know any better You d be hard pressed to find anybody to say Teh Jeang had a habit of acting inappropriately But that s exactly what he did in when he stood up in a scientific meeting in Leuven Belgium as Frank Ruscetti was getting ready to talk and started shouting Stop studying this Study a real virus Stop wasting money on this Wasting money Wasting money I was in Frank s office at the National Cancer Institute on Monday morning January when Kathy came into the room with the news that Kuan Teh Jeang was dead At first it was said he d died of a heart attack at his office on Sunday night Then we heard that he d shot himself at his desk The last story I heard was that he killed himself by jumping off the four story parking garage at the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases Really You kill yourself by jumping thirty feet to the pavement It might kill you but there s also going to be a whole lot of pain To this day I have no idea how he died We endorse everything that was said about Teh Jeang in his obituary That was consistent with the scientist we d known for decades However it was not consistent with the man who opposed us in the XMRV debate That person was unhinged Here s the only explanation for Teh Jeang s death that makes sense to me I think it s entirely likely that in the middle of the XMRV debate Teh Jeang believed what people like Tony Fauci and John Coffin were saying that XMRV was simply a lab contaminant and had not infected the population in great numbers These arguments take place on the very edge of scientific knowledge so when a well educated person makes a claim and seems to have some reasonable evidence it s easy to believe them Teh Jeang s obituary talks about how he was a tireless force driving change and was always urging people to do better Even though he d savagely attacked XMRV as the editor of Retrovirology he was able to see the latest research prior to publication He got to see all the papers His job was to know things BEFORE other people knew them Other scientists were discovering different strains of XMRV and how it was associated with disease which is exactly what one would expect with a newly discovered retrovirus family It s likely that XMRV is like Spleen Focus Forming Virus which needs another helper virus in order to cause damage Viruses will combine and recombine with other viruses in the vicinity making it a challenge to identify which virus is causing the problem Even in HIV most of the viruses are defective They re not infectious and transmissible They re doing their damage to the immune system through other mechanisms I believe Teh Jeang was smart enough to understand this exotic biology especially when even critics like Coffin were finding that XMRVs might need as little as ten days to recombine with another virus and create a new replication competent retrovirus 7 These viruses might be bits and pieces of other viruses which is why if you looked at the virus too narrowly you d miss it Those who really understand viruses know the best comparison of a virus is probably to a piece of computer code Yes if you have an entire computer program like a complete virus that s probably a more robust system But you can also have strings of computer code that can mess up your machine I think in a similar way you often don t need an entire virus maybe just a few hundred base pairs of a viral envelope perhaps to affect immune function We call these viral particles and act as if they re not harmful but I think that view is likely to be mistaken I think Teh Jeang was troubled by this He started to figure it out At first he probably kept his doubts to himself Then he d start to discuss his concerns with a few close friends people able to understand the science and the politics like his boss Tony Fauci There are three people I place in what Frank Ruscetti calls the Unholy Trinity of Science and they are Harold Varmus Francis Collins and Tony Fauci Whenever you ask yourself why the truth hasn t been told in a critical area of public health you ll probably find the fingerprints of these men at the crime scene How does Fauci respond Maybe he tries to convince TehJeang that his fears are unwarranted But Teh Jeang would persist He d want facts Fauci couldn t provide those and if he did lie Teh Jeang would see through the lies The system depends on smart people But in order to draw those people in you must also make them believe in what they re doing It sets up an imbalance if you re going to do something unethical Every scientist wants to think their work has integrity To call a scientist a liar is the worst epithet you can use I strongly believe an impasse was reached between Fauci and his second in command Teh Jeang What happened after that point I can t tell you Was Teh Jeang shamed by what he d done As a Chinese man honor was very important to him Did he do things of which he was ashamed Or did Fauci after it was clear to him that Teh Jeang could not beturned place a call and give an order Was Teh Jeang getting ready to go rogue Fauci might not have known what exactly would happen but he knew something would happen The rumor is that Teh Jeang left a suicide note which was confiscated by the National Institutes of Health police I wonder if it resembles the torn up note found in Vince Foster s briefcase De rol van Fort Detrick Mike has a wonderful perspective on this issue and his story leads back to Fort Detrick Maryland and one of my early jobs in science working as a young protein chemist purifying interferon in the Fermentation Chemistry lab and doing immune therapy for cancer and AIDS at the Biological Response Modifiers program with Frank Ruscetti in the early s Francis Collins Fauci en AIDS It felt as if everybody in the auditorium turned to look at Francis Collins when he raised a hand to ask a question Yes I said my heart pounding Where did you get the percent positive controls Collins asked The blood supply in the UK I explained noting we d also obtained fifty or sixty additional positive controls age and sex matched to the UK ME CFS patients I think that was the moment Collins decided he needed to call Dr Tony Fauci head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease NIAID Finally no longer would these suffering patients be considered crazy and denied the same type of therapies that had ended the threat of HIV AIDS But little did I know that Dr Fauci was not about to let this happen What did Fauci do He called in Dr Ian Lipkin to lead that validation study Dr Ian Lipkin of Columbia University the great debunker who had participated in a similar shameful episode against a doctor I ve now come to know well Dr Andrew Wakefield In my estimation Dr Wakefield is our greatest scientific martyr for his initial suspicions voiced in a series of case reports for The Lancet of a connection between the MMR measles mumps rubella shot and the development of gastrointestinal problems and autism When I met my attorney Mike Hugo he said This might sound a little strange but I ve got an expression for what I think has happened to you What s that I asked You ve been Wakefielded I laughed I know Andy We had talked at length about a study we had done looking for an association of XMRV with ITP in collaboration with Dr James Bussels of New York City ITP is idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura a disorder that can lead to easy and excessive bruising and is thought to result from low levels of platelets that help with blood clotting ITP is a CDC acknowledged side effect of MMR We found evidence of ITP in percent of the sixty or so patient samples we tested with our serology test Interestingly there was no correlation with fatigue I thought speaking to the head of the National Institutes of Health about a solution to our biggest health crisis since the HIV AIDS epidemic was the moment when science would fulfill its most important duty to the public Instead Collins was setting me up with Lipkin the same man who had Wakefielded Dr Andrew Wakefield And looking over it all would be Tony Fauci head of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the boss of Kuan Teh Jeang editor of the journal Retrovirology who would also eventually die under mysterious circumstances just like my friend Jeff Bradstreet RNA en DNA While nobody knows the answer the current thinking is that RNA must have been a precursor to DNA used by the most primitive organisms at the very dawn of life on our planet Nature in her unparalleled efficiency uses nucleic acid building blocks RNA in DNA for essentially all organisms but those pathogens that are made of RNA like retroviruses need an enzyme to transform their RNA into DNA and insert itself into the hosts DNA blueprint in order for the virus to survive A retrovirus cannot live or replicate without using the machinery of the host cell Retrovirussen Reverse transcriptase is prone to copying errors causing retroviruses to easily mutate into viruses with wildly different genetic profiles That means there can be large variations between different strains of a single type of retrovirus This trait of retroviruses made many scientists believe they could never cause much harm to humans because they seemed to be well unstable Since they are usually easily silenced and crippled most have dismissed them as noninfectious junk DNA That may be one reason John Coffin and Harold Varmus both told Frank not to bother looking for disease causing human retroviruses Retroviruses seemed like some biological relic of our far distant past interesting in the way a platypus intrigues us with its combination of mammal bird and reptilian features But HIV AIDS was a wake up call to the danger of retroviruses They could be just as dangerous as the typical virus But HIV really was an outlier among retroviruses It killed its victims within a few years HIV killed relatively quickly for a retrovirus XMRVs disabled keeping their hosts alive but in a state where they could generally not regain their health Het probleem met vaccines Here are two things that cannot both be true Vaccines are as safe as sugar water Vaccines carry such risk thatnobody is liable for injury Claims may only be brought in a special court where the parents of vaccine injured children face off against Department of Justice attorneys This special Vaccine Court was established by law under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act Many of you are probably learning about this court for the first time The Act removes liability from pharmaceutical companies for any injuries or deaths caused by their childhood vaccines It also only allows discovery of pharmaceutical company documents with the approval of the court This is dramatically different from the typical products liability action in which the company must turn over all relevant documents In addition each case is unique meaning that if a vaccine has been found to cause a certain injury in one case that cannot be relied upon in any way in a subsequent case In addition parents may not seek documents on the safety of vaccines from the companies that produced them unless given specific permission from the court And if one parent is successful in making a claim of harm from a certain vaccine that information is then hidden from others who want to make a similar claim If vaccines were as safe as sugar water then there would be no need for such a system Is there a soda court where claims against soft drinks are made defended by Department of Justice attorneys Zoonotic ziektes zijn een belangrijk probleem en dus waarom worden ze genegeerd Tens of thousands of Americans at the very least will get sick every year from illnesses spread by some form of association with animals Zoonotic diseases account for more than percent of known infectious diseases and at least percent of new emerging infectious diseases This is probably one of the biggest challenges in public heath you ve never heard about even though you can find it prominently displayed on the CDC website What are some of these diseases you might ask This is a partial list anthrax bird flu bovine tuberculosis cat scratch fever dengue fever Ebola encephalitis from ticks enzootic abortion hemorrhagic colitis hepatitis E listeria infection Lyme disease malaria parrot fever plague rabies rat bite fever ringworm Rocky Mountain spotted fever swine flu toxoplasmosis West Nile virus and zoonotic diphtheria 2 And the biggest zoonotic disease that is not covered in that list is HIV AIDS which affected more than sixty million people leading to our world s greatest modern plague Hypotheses over de oorzaak van HIV AIDS en de mogelijke rol van vaccinaties While a good deal of ink has been dedicated to the question of how prejudice against the gay lifestyle delayed efforts to properly address the disease our job as scientists is to provide an explanation of events in the past and how problems might be avoided in the future Let s make sure we understand our terms The human immunodeficiency virus HIV is linked to the condition known as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome AIDS There was a brief time when the disease was known as gay related immune disease GRID and many activists claim the name change to AIDS prompted a more balanced examination of the disease Perhaps this is true But what of the genesis of the retrovirus HIV Where did it come from We have a clear answer It came from a primate The field agrees the precursor to HIV was the simian immunodeficiency virus or SIV To be more precise the human virus came from a monkey or chimpanzee virus After that any potential areas of agreement break down I vividly recall working as a technician at the Biological Response Modifiers Program at Fort Detrick in the early s where it was my job to isolate HIV from samples and find a cell line or tissue to grow the virus If you can t grow the virus outside a human body you can t study it What we were told at the time was that the disease probably jumped to humans as a result of Africans forgetting how to cook their food in this case chimpanzees often referred to as bush meat and that the promiscuous sexual lifestyles of African peoples with implications of possible bestiality with primates led to the cross species jump and spread of the virus among the human population I am now appalled that at the time we did not more closely question these assumptions Since that time there have been two competing and in my mind closely related theories of how a chimpanzee retrovirus made the jump to humans The first was popularized by the journalist Edward Hooper and expanded upon in his lengthy book The River A Journey to the Source of HIV and AIDS for which he conducted more than six hundred interviews Of the interviews conducted Hooper was most impressed with evolutionary biologist Bill Hamilton who along with other independent researchers such as Louis Pascal Tom Curtis and Blaine Elswood was proposing an idea that before my work with XMRV I would have found quite radical They proposed that the jump from chimpanzees to humans came as a result of vaccine trials in the Belgian Congo from to in which more than five hundred common chimpanzees and bonobos pygmy chimpanzees were killed so that their kidney cells and sera could be used to grow the oral polio vaccine This vaccine was subsequently administered to more than a million Africans during that time period Hooper suggests there was great resistance to this idea since even in the late s and early s there was little public support for the idea of using chimpanzees in such medical experiments In addition the Belgian royal family was publicly supporting the idea of wildlife conservation and the revelation of these actions would go against that image Hooper believes another reason for resistance to his idea is that if his theory was accepted it would shake public confidence in the medical establishment as well as lead to multibillion dollar class action lawsuits for the AIDS epidemic The second plausible theory which has come to be known as the bush meat theory is that sometime early in the twentieth century an individual became infected with SIV from handling chimpanzees or chimpanzee bushmeat It usually involves the actions of some anonymous native hunter often called the cut hunter because he cut himself shortly after having killed a chimpanzee Added to this scenario is urbanization encroaching upon the jungle allowing it to be spread by those newly introduced western evils of prostitution and intravenous drug usage When you think about it you come to the realization there s a battle of narratives with science having a definite preference for one over the other In the first scenario unwitting scientists release a plague of massive proportions on the population because of their use of questionable animal experiments infecting more than sixty million people and causing the death of at least thirty nine million In the second scenario a chance event in a jungle encounter with an infected chimpanzee leads to cross species transmission then because it s always a good play to blame urbanization and prostitution as well as maybe a little inadvertent help from western medicine and you have a new disease After Hooper made his claim that the oral polio vaccine grown in chimpanzee tissue and given to humans was the source of the HIV AIDS epidemic there was an investigation As I read Hooper s account it sounded a lot like the Ian Lipkin investigation into XMRV In this great investigation they sampled stocks of polio vaccine from the period for traces of chimpanzee DNA or simian virus Lo and behold they found NOTHING There s just one problem All of the samples they used were from the United States They did not have any samples of polio vaccine from Africa The samples of polio vaccine from the United States had never used chimpanzee tissues as a growth medium or cell line They DID NOT test African samples of the oral polio vaccine for that which used chimpanzee tissue This is what Hooper wrote about the supposed investigation into the use of chimpanzee tissue in the development of the polio vaccine that was performed by the Royal Society in September of Instead of the open and honest debate and the even handed investigation of the OPV theory which had been promised what actually took place was a carefully planned attempt to suppress the theory by fair means or foul And this only considers the polio vaccine Every vaccine has been grown in animal tissue usually of several different species including monkey mouse bird and cow Each one of these cross species events has the potential to transfer a pathogen to humans or to create some new strain that can cause harm We have fired several billion bullets of biological ammunition at the human species and it is the height of arrogance to believe we have caused zero damage Hoe om te gaan met micro organsmen For more than a century we ve been promoting two different concepts which when you think about it are fundamentally at odds with each other The first concept is that we need to ensure our food air and water is as free of pollutants and pathogens as possible I have no problem saying I m in favor of this effort a hundred percent The second concept involves the belief that we need to prime our immune system with weakened or dead pathogens in order to deal with any challenges that might come our way over the course of a lifetime This is the fundamental idea behind vaccinations I think we re committing overkill of a good idea and it is leading to tragic unintended consequences If we are living in a relatively clean environment and we have proper nutrition then our immune system is going to develop naturally I ve heard many activists make the claim that vaccinations create fake immunity whereas a robust immune system is more likely to be able to respond to any pathogens that might be encountered in the course of our regular lives in a relatively clean environment I have a great deal of sympathy for this position De merkwaardige evolutie van Ebola Are we really to believe that in thousands of years of hunting that Africans did not contract Ebola It really seems comical to even suggest such a scenario I believe these pathogens have likely been living in Africans for thousands of years until we did something to disturb the immune system balance of the people of that continent The recent emergence of pathogenic Zika in Brazil and Columbia is also supported by that hypothesis What you do with a vaccination is you temporarily cripple a part of the immune system as resources are diverted from protecting against other viruses to target the virus from the vaccine With multiple vaccinations you cripple several parts of the immune system at the same time and do nothing to restore the balance of the system We don t know what diseases we are spreading by rendering compromised immune systems susceptible It makes me angry because some of the best people in the world like Christian missionaries and medical aid workers are going to these countries and creating the conditions for terrible outbreaks They are sending our very best people to unwittingly do the very worst things for the health of humanity Let s return to the CDC s own website for a listing of outbreaks and numbers of deaths to see if you can t discern a troubling pattern The Sudan outbreak of had reported cases with fatalities The CDC website reports The outbreak is believed to have started with workers in a cotton factory where of workers in the cloth room were infected Are we really to believe that workers at a cloth factory of all the places in Africa were the most likely to have been out in the bush hunting for monkeys and contracted this virus Or is it more likely that just prior to coming down with Ebola there was a workplace vaccination campaign The other outbreak that year in Zaire had reported cases with deaths although not much information is provided about the circumstances of that first appearance In there was only one person who contracted Ebola in Zaire and died We jump next to when there was another outbreak in the same area of the Sudan as the outbreak The numbers though were much smaller this time There were thirty four reported cases with only twenty two fatalities A full ten years pass until we see Ebola again this time in and in two locations one in the Philippines and one in the United States Both were wait for it facilities that housed monkeys In this same Ebola Reston virus was introduced to other quarantine facilities in Virginia and Texas by monkeys imported from the Philippines In Ebola Reston virus was introduced into quarantine facilities in Siena Italy by monkeys from the Philippines In there was high mortality reported among chimpanzees in a forest in the Ivory Coast and a scientist became ill after conducting an autopsy on a wild chimpanzee but later recovered During that same year an outbreak occurred in several gold mining villages in the rainforest around Makakou Gabon There were fifty two reported cases and thirty one deaths In there was an outbreak associated with a charcoal maker in the forested area around Kikwit Democratic Republic of the Congo formerly Zaire There were reported cases and deaths In there were several small outbreaks There was one reported case from Russia where a Russian laboratory worker was infected while working on an experimental treatment for Ebola There were two outbreaks in monkey facilities in the Philippines and in Texas with monkeys imported from the Philippines All was calm for the next four years until when in Uganda there was an outbreak of reported cases and deaths In there was an outbreak in the Republic of the Congo with fifty nine cases and fortythree deaths and one in Gabon with sixty five cases and fifty three deaths In there was another outbreak in the Republic of the Congo with reported cases and deaths In an outbreak in the Republic of the Congo had thirty five reported cases and twenty nine deaths In a Russian laboratory worker who was working on an Ebola vaccine was accidentally injected with the virus and died In the Sudan there were seventeen reported cases and seven deaths In a small outbreak occurred starting with two hunters in the Republic of the Congo Twelve people were affected and there were ten deaths No cases were reported in but in a new strain appeared in Uganda which was significantly less lethal There were cases but only forty two deaths In the Republic of the Congo there were cases and deaths In there was another small outbreak in the Republic of the Congo with thirty two cases and fifteen deaths In the Philippines the Ebola virus jumped to pigs and infected six workers at a pig farm but they did not develop symptoms Nothing was reported for three more years until when a single person was infected with Ebola in Uganda and died In there was an outbreak in Uganda that affected six people and caused three deaths In the Republic of the Congo there was an outbreak with thirty six cases and thirteen deaths Nothing happened in but saw the largest number of Ebola cases ever In the Republic of the Congo there were sixty nine cases and forty nine deaths In the West African countries of Guinea Liberia and Sierra Leone there were and In Italy there was one case of an Italian healthcare worker who d volunteered during the epidemic but he survived In Mali an infected traveler brought the disease resulting in eight cases and six deaths In Nigeria an infected traveler was responsible for twenty cases and eight deaths In Senegal an infected traveler was responsible for one case but no deaths In Spain a healthcare worker became infected while treating a patient evacuated from Sierra Leone but he recovered In the United States there were four confirmed cases with two being nurses who were treating an Ebola patient on American soil One person died in the United States outbreak Next we jump forward three years to when there were eight cases and four deaths in the Republic of the Congo In there was another outbreak in the Republic of the Congo with fifty four cases and thirty three deaths The World Health Organization declared the outbreak over on July This was the ninth recorded outbreak of Ebola in the Republic of the Congo In just a little over two pages I ve provided the approximately twenty known outbreaks of Ebola and a brief description of the circumstances of each outbreak Now let s really try to consider what s happening Let s leave aside for a moment the question of why this disease suddenly appeared in Instead let s focus on the ten instances of Ebola appearing in animal or scientific facilities In there was an outbreak of Ebola at a primate facility in the Philippines In there was an outbreak of Ebola at primate facilities in Virginia and Pennsylvania In there was an Ebola outbreak at monkey quarantine facilities in Virginia and Texas In a Russian lab worker was infected with Ebola while working on an experimental treatment In there was an Ebola outbreak in monkey facilities in the Philippines In there was an outbreak of Ebola at monkey facilities in Texas with monkeys imported from the Philippines In there was another laboratory worker in Russia who was accidentally injected with the virus and died In the Ebola virus somehow made a jump into pigs and from there infected six workers but none of them developed symptoms Is it just my imagination or are some of the most likely places on Earth to contract Ebola a scientific lab or hanging around with monkeys in cages presumably in unhealthy conditions Not monkeys in the wild Let s move onto the West African outbreak In a little bit of research we came across an interesting account written by Hong Kongbased journalist and former editor of The Japan Times in Tokyo science writer Yoichi Shimatsu However it seems clear to me that there were three separate vaccination campaigns PRIOR to the West African Ebola outbreak You simply have to consult news accounts to learn about all of these vaccination campaigns I ve talked about how one of the major problems with multiple vaccinations is the so called war and Peace of the viruses in which each virus preoccupies a different part of the immune system leading to a compromised immune system I give you this publication from the CDC titled Emergence of Vaccine Derived Polioviruses during Ebola Virus Disease Outbreak Guinea Did you catch that term Vaccine Derived Polioviruses And it happened during an Ebola outbreak Not among those who came down with the disease but simply in the community The abstract reads During the outbreak of Ebola virus disease in Guinea type circulating vaccine derived polioviruses cVDPVs were isolated from polio patients and healthy contact To clarify the genetic properties of cVDPVs and their emergence we combined epidemiologic and virologic data for polio cases in Guinea Deviation of public health resources to the Ebola outbreak disrupted polio vaccination programs and surveillance activities which fueled the spread of neurovirulent VDPVs in an area of low vaccination coverage and immunity 15 There are times when my dear colleagues in science make me want to bang my head against a wall Let s take that final sentence from the abstract Deviation of public health resources to the Ebola outbreak disrupted polio vaccination programs and surveillance activities which fueled the spread of neurovirulent VDPVs in an area of low vaccination coverage and immunity Let s translate that mumbo jumbo into something understandable Then you ll realize how that sentence makes no sense It should read something like this Because of the Ebola outbreak we couldn t give our polio vaccines and that promoted the spread of polio viruses from our vaccines Really I encourage you to come up with any other translation Conclusie Here s what it really means to me Our vaccines are generating new viruses and in areas with low immune function think poor and impoverished or they re getting so many vaccinations that their immune system is going haywire trying to keep up we re making sure these people will get some type of serious viral diseases like HIV Ebola or Zika De productie van VAXXED en wat is er aan de hand met Robert De Niro Eventually they would work with Del Bigtree an Emmy winning Hollywood television producer who had worked on The Dr Phil Show as well as the medical talk show The Doctors This group would go on to produce a documentary about this case titled VAXXED From Cover Up to Conspiracy The relationship between Hooker and Thompson grew so close that Hooker was able to convince Thompson to apply for federal whistleblower protection and release a statement through his attorney to the press about his claims The film was controversial to people who never actually sat in a theater and watched it most famously being accepted into the prestigious Tribeca Film Festival then getting disinvited when protests were made to festival founder Robert De Niro So much for artistic freedom It was not De Niro s finest hour It was revealed at the time that De Niro had an eighteen year old son with autism and his wife said he changed after a vaccination Apparently De Niro had been away filming and didn t feel he could comment with any accuracy on his wife s claim Way to support your wife Perhaps it does not come as a surprise that Mr De Niro and his wife broke up a few years later De wonderen van cannabis maar de industrie heeft liever vaccines Although only discovered in I believe the endocannabinoid system is one of the most important systems in the body The endocannabinoid system has been called the supercomputer that regulates homeostasis in the body It consists of a group of molecules known as cannabinoids and the receptors to which they bind We ve learned that these receptors regulate a variety of functions including appetite pain inflammation thermoregulation muscle control metabolism and even controls our response to stress Professor Raphael Mechoulam widely acknowledged as the father of cannabis medicine has gone so far as to state that the Endocannabinoid system is involved in essentially all disease states Cannabis has been found to have anticonvulsant antipsychotic anti inflammatory antioxidant and antidepressant properties among others When our bodies are under stress we can t make our natural cannabinoids This is certainly true of those with ME CFS and children with autism as well as those with cancer It might surprise you to discover that besides hemp and cannabis the only other rich source of naturally occurring cannabinoids can be found in mother s milk Yes that s right mother s milk has cannabinoids How many wonderful things can we say about what Mother Nature has provided us in mother s milk I believe that with the findings that cannabinoid receptors are present in the brain and stem cells we have an explanation for why cannabis has therapeutic benefits for many chronic illnesses Even small doses of plant derived cannabinoids can signal the body to make more of its own cannabinoids and can also stimulate the building of more cannabinoid receptors A functional endocannabinoid system is essential for our health Because of censorship and corruption in the science of cannabis many of the studies have been hidden or misrepresented to the public and medical community Like any natural product made into a therapeutic it needs the expertise and commitment of scientists in order to translate unbiased science into useful therapeutics However we think formulations of cannabis should be one of the first things that a practitioner uses and can help in a wide variety of situations as a low cost and remarkably safe intervention Our job as translational scientists is to quickly pursue these safe supportive therapies free from political bias This has not happened to date For example I m sure you ve heard about the water crisis in Flint Michigan where high levels of lead were allowed to be in the drinking water When that story broke I said Just throw the cannabis in the water It s a natural heavy metal detoxifying plant Just don t use it after that Purify it I m talking about an extract of the whole plant that has been purified It s a huge detoxifier and it would pull out all the heavy metals There are very simple cheap and effective ways to pull these heavy metals out of people Once we know what the enemy is we can devise strategies to fight it The other benefit of cannabis is that the endocannabinoid system is a lipid signaling system that is critical to the function of hematopoietic stem cells and the mesenchymal stem cells which means we re talking about the proper functioning of the brain immune system digestive system and heart It probably helps to think of your body as one gigantic signaling system The mitochondria are at the heart of this signaling system because if you don t have the proper amount of energy all the organs of the body must compensate by shutting down or running at reduced power and function One of the things we re trying to understand is what the biological markers of hibernating bears look like We expect many of them will resemble the markers of those with ME CFS and other neuroimmune diseases By quieting the inflammation in the nervous system assisting in cellular signaling and restoring the balance of the endocannabinoid system cannabis can play a vital role in recovery for many individuals Pentagon is bezig met onderzoek naar autisme en de mogelijke behandeling daarvan Huh Further on in the article they note that two years after treatment the symptoms had decreased in severity by percent And while at the beginning percent of the patients were rated as being on the severe end of the autism spectrum after two years that number dropped to percent with percent having improved so much that they no longer qualified as having autism Regardless of your opinion of the cause of autism and many of the other chronic mental and neurological problems in our country this is hopeful news There are caveats to be certain such as making sure that no harmful bacteria are cultured in the mixture provided to the patients I also think it s necessary to make sure that a patient s leaky gut is fixed meaning there s no perforations in the intestinal lining like what Wakefield first found Leaky gut is now alleged to occur in many different conditions which is another reason why I think that even if we re talking about autism or ME CFS the lessons are probably applicable to many different diseases However there s one thing that concerns me even more It s the last sentence I quote where it says the paper so impressed the Pentagon that the Department of Defense agreed to fund a large study of microbial transplants in adults with autism The Pentagon The Department of Defense Why are military organizations taking the lead on this issue Aren t they involved in building planes ships submarines tanks bombs and missiles Shouldn t it be the National Institutes of Health The Centers for Disease Control Last time I checked the Pentagon was in charge of killing bad guys not healing the sick Or is there another agenda at work here Military families must submit to vaccinations and many have claimed the children of service members have rates of autism and other neurological conditions that are much higher than those of the general public Perhaps our military is trying to fix the daily battle so many of their families face in their homes so their members will be able to fight the battles we wage in distant lands De smeercampagne tegen Frank Rusceti I believe the campaign against Frank Ruscetti kicked into high gear after the First International Symposium on XMRV when the response to the critical question of Francis Collins of where we got the control group results of percent from the United Kingdom was from blood bank samples in that country It was after that meeting that Collins tasked Fauci to fund and conduct a confirmation study of our work Apparently the study by Shyh Ching Lo and Harvey Alter a Lasker Award winning scientist wasn t enough of a confirmation to satisfy them Maybe it was a coincidence but prior to the National Cancer Institute was run by a fine doctor named John Niederhuber who was supportive of the work with XMRV and prostate cancer But what happened in just as the XMRV freight train was gathering momentum They brought in Harold Varmus to take over from John Niederhuber Just so you know how absurd this was you should know that Harold Varmus was director of the National Institutes of Health from to in the Bill Clinton administration The National Cancer Institute is a division of the National Institutes of Health After leaving as director of the National Institutes of Health Varmus went to work as the president of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City where he served for ten years Tags COVID Boeknotities HIV AIDS corruptie Wetenschap Post Tags promoted carousel

4728,4728,Sandra Pel√°ez Background People who leave their country of origin or the country of habitual residence to establish themselves permanently in another country are usually referred to as migrants Over half of all births in Montreal Canada are to migrant women To understand healthcare professionals attitudes towards migrants that could influence their delivery of care our objective was to explore their perspectives of challenges newly arrived migrant women from non Western countries face when needing maternity care Method In this qualitative multiple case study we conducted face to face interviews with health care professionals from four teaching hospitals in Montreal known for providing maternity care to a high volume of migrant women Interviews were transcribed and thematically analysed Results Physicians nurses social workers and therapists participated were female and were themselves migrants from non Western countries According to participants newly arrived migrant women face challenges at two levels a direct care e g understanding Canadian health care professionals expectations communicating effectively with health care professionals and b organizational e g access to appropriate health care Challenges women face are strongly influenced by the migrant woman s background as well as social position e g general education health literacy socio cultural integration and by how health care professionals balance women s needs with perceived requirement to adhere to standard procedures and regulations Conclusions Health care professionals across institutions agreed that maternity care related challenges faced by newly arrived migrant women often are complex in that they are simultaneously driven by conflicting values those based on migrant women s sociocultural backgrounds versus those related to the implementation of Canadian guidelines for maternity care in which consideration of migrant women s particular needs are not priority KeywordsMigrantCase studyCanadaHealth servicesHealthcare providersPregnancyChildbirth This work was presented at the North American Refugee Health Conference NARHC held in Toronto Canada Sganarelle As tu bien la hardiesse de t opposer au m√©decin Hors de l√† Lucas Je me moque de √ßa Sganarelle Je te donnerai la fi√®vre Moli√®re Le malade imaginaire Hachette Paris Background International migration is defined as a movement of persons who leave their country of origin or the country of habitual residence to establish themselves either permanently or temporarily in another country p There are approximately million international migrants worldwide Half of all births in Montreal and over one fifth of births in Canada are to women who migrated to Canada from other countries This trend is projected to continue and it has been estimated that by of Canadians will have at least one parent born outside Canada and belonging to a minority group Despite the constant growth of migrant communities in Western countries research depicting the relationship between migrant women and maternity care is scant We therefore explored health care professionals perspectives of challenges newly arrived migrant women to Canada coming from non Western countries face when needing maternity care in order to better understand clinical practices towards these women Health care inequities Migrant women s access to health care requires attention especially during the first years of migration when adaptation to the receiving country is taking place Despite an international call to recognise both the health of migrants as a human right and the need for migrant sensitive health policies and programs due to health care inequities some migrant women arriving in high income level countries may a face multiple health risks b not receive the health care they need and c face along with their infants multiple health care related risks Health care inequities observed in health care differences in the services provided to and received by two or more groups that are translated to health outcomes represent a complex phenomenon Factors related to health care inequities have been classified into three main levels pertaining to a the patient b the provider and c the health care system At the patient level the most common factors include source country language different than that of the receiving country conditions associated to the movement itself legal status length of time in the receiving country financial and administrative hurdles lack of transportation to health care centres reports of stigma discrimination and social exclusion socio cultural barriers isolation fear of harming chances for successful resettlement previous negative experience with the health care system and refusal of treatment or decision of leaving health problems unaddressed Also at the provider level clinical practices embedded with racism and ethnic biases have been consistently reported from health care professionals towards migrant women Finally at the health care system level the most notable factor associated with health care inequities was the existence of regulatory restrictions on access to state finaced health care While presenting the factors associated with health care inequities by levels is informative it creates the impression that the majority of factors hindering the appropriate care of migrant women pertain to the patient level Instead building on reports analysing governmental responses to populations in vulnerable conditions we could argue that health care inequity of migrants relies on the complex interaction of different factors determined by the existence of socio culturally non inclusive norms and lack of policies in the receiving country Theoretical framework Post colonial theories argue that during colonial times European ethno centric reference norms related to individual and collective social experiences such as gender education religion and race were established and supported Values not conforming these standards were questioned and various forms of inequity and oppression were fostered These norms cannot be analysed as purely separate entities because they are seen as mutually reinforcing and interacting to preserve traditional colonial values In the field of health post colonial theories have been used to identify and understand health care inequities as well as to advance health care professionals knowledge These theories have shown that different minority groups have been marginalised by institutions that hold colonial values It has been argued that these groups should be repositioned and empowered within a culturally safe environment that listens to their voices considers their knowledge respects and recognises their values beliefs and rights and makes institutions more inclusive Newly arrived migrant women coming from non Western countries represent a minority group whose values and standards have been often questioned Some health care professionals guided by the perceptions they have of their patients may use the power associated with their position to revindicate certain values that contribute to health care inequities creating a distance between us and them i e their patients Methods Research design and epistemological stance We designed a qualitative multiple case study with the goal of gathering rich and detailed information about health care professionals perspectives of the challenges newly arrived migrant women face when needing maternity care We examined within case analysis and compared cross case analysis four maternity care units focusing on the how and why of contextual factors that influence the health care professionals perspectives and assumptions concerning the referred population We used a post colonial conceptual framework referred to in the introduction to guide our study Participants and procedures After obtaining ethics approval from the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre we purposefully selected four Montreal teaching hospitals to be our cases based on the high volume of births to international migrants attended in their maternity units We aimed to interview ten key informants from each hospital working in maternity units antepartum birthing centre and postpartum having different professional backgrounds and work roles A nurse manager at each institution helped us identifying potential interviewees who were contacted via telephone e mail and or in person Those who agreed to participate were asked to suggest other informants whose viewpoint or experience would represent an important contribution to the study Therefore we combined purposive and snowball sampling to ensure a varied range of informants were included Data collection The first author conducted face to face semi structured open ended interviews to discuss challenges as perceived by health care professionals newly migrant women experience when needing maternity care As we were committed to learn the logic underlying health care professionals perspectives we respected the interview schedule to compare data across the four cases but we adopted a flexible attitude towards exploring other ideas raised by interviewees Interviews were conducted in the participants language of choice English or French and lasted approximately one hour M = min range = min A second follow up interview with the nurse manager at each hospital was conducted weeks after the first The purpose of this interview was to present preliminary data share preliminary results elicit additional information and discuss whether more interviews were needed Eighty seven percent of participants accepted to have their interviews audio recorded During those interviews observational notes were taken Immediately following the interviews the interviewer listened to the recordings and wrote memos reflecting the thoughts and potential venues of analysis These memos were then compared with the observational notes Interviews were transcribed verbatim Transcripts were verfied against tapes for accuracy corrected if needed and stored in a secured place In cases in which participants did not agree to be recorded we took copious notes during the interview that were used for analysis Data analysis Guided by our research question we followed the analytical procedures proposed by Ritchie and Spencer This analytic approach relies on five interconnected stages a familiarisation b identification of a thematic framework c indexing d charting and e mapping and interpretation As data collection was conducted in parallel with data analysis we identified key concepts and explored them in depth in subsequent interviews thus familiarisation with the material consisted of reading the transcripts to have both a sense of the material collected and to adjust if needed the interview guide Then we proceeded to the identification of a preliminary framework reflecting participants perspectives as well as theoretical discussions on the topic We used this analytic structure for indexing the data a procedure most commonly referred to as coding e g By doing this we identified certain patterns and initial associations among them As while indexing we were looking to answer contextual i e identify the form and nature of what is already in place and diagnostic i e examining the reasons for or causes of what exists questions we searched for both single codes and narrative units i e stories that allowed us to reconstruct participants perspectives We then proceeded to the charting step which entailed organising data previously synthesised and abstracted into themes by lifting it from its original context and arranging it depending on established relationships Following this step we compared the data within each case i e participant by participant and between cases i e each case compared to the others This practice allowed us to track and contextualise issues related to power status and professional roles that emerged across participants narratives and across cases Finally we proceeded to the mapping and interpretation step that consisted of redefining concepts by comparing and contrasting key dimensions themes and patterns creating typologies by linking dimensions and themes and finding associations among themes Throughout the analysis we wrote analytical memos that were used to develop our ideas organise our reflections and support the presentation of evidence A qualitative software package MAXQDA VERBI GmbH Software version Germany was used to code and organize the data As a research team we engaged in collaborative analysis by sharing a constant dialogue in which we discussed our positions viewpoints biases and interpretations We also created a vignette to illustrate participants voices and presented it to different colleagues who gave us feedback and contributed to reshaping it This triangulation of perspectives mainly done via the discussion and review of both field memos and analytical memos enhanced our self reflection during the analysis The analytic meetings were subject to an audit trail that we used to support our evolution towards a more abstract and conceptual representation of data Results Participants characteristics Although initially we aimed to interview ten participants per institution we continued the interviews until it was agreed that data were sufficient Sixty three participants in total were interviewed Case n = Case n = Case n = Case n = Ninety percent of participants were female and were themselves migrants from non Western countries Participants professional backgrounds and roles included three family doctors five obstetricians four medical residents one nutritionist one anesthesiologist seven social workers one art therapist one psychologist one spiritual consultant and nurses Health care professionals perceptions of challenges migrant women face regarding maternity care We identified three main themes across participants discussions Under the first theme women s start up conditions at the time of needing maternity care we grouped issues that referred to how the integration in the receiving society was mediated by participants characteristics such as how women s Canadian status represented an obstacle or facilitated access to the health care system According to the participants the length of time migrant women have been living in Canada was a key component that smoothed the challenges these women faced due to adaptation to the demands and characteristics of the receiving society The second theme dealt with participants perspectives concerning challenges migrant women face concerning health care Examples included balancing personal expectations and socio cultural beliefs establishing an effective communication with health care professionals and having support within the health care system e g a person helping with translation to better follow the consultations Also challenges related to dealing with the heath care system were included in this theme Examples of challenges related to the health care system included understanding how to a navigate the system b get access to standard care and c effectively receive necessary care The third theme Canadian standards of maternity care referred to the principles procedures actions measures and standards that are driven by Canadian health care guidelines national and provincial laws and case specific institutional policies missions and responsibilities guiding health care professionals clinical practices According to the participants these health care standards while aimed at providing the best response to the patients medical condition do not necessarily respond to the individual s psychosocial needs Keeping in mind that existing health care inequities affecting minorities is a complex phenomenon we portrayed the findings including both the participants and the researchers voices using a narrative writing approach and more specifically a nonfiction first person figurative vignette The purpose of the vignette was to develop a compelling insightful and meaningful account illustrating data as voiced by participants and perceived by researchers As we began to understand the health care professionals perspectives through the interviews the meaning behind their reasoning and behaviors sometimes hidden behind the complexity of the phenomenon and embedded in the participants discourse became clearer for us The vignette compiled participants perspectives resulting from both lifted raw data i e in vivo words phrases features of participants speech e g moments of silence as well as rephrased participants contributions resulting from our interpretation and representation of recreated meanings As m aking choices is a part of the composing process p we decided to put together most significant participants contributions we identified when charting data juxtaposing participants voices and our voices and articulating our theoretical interpretation and explanation of the phenomenon Health care professionals perspectives regarding challenges newly arrived migrant women in Montreal face when needing maternity care a vignette of study findings So you want to discuss what are according to me the challenges newly arrived migrant women go through at the time they need maternity care ok Well that s a tricky question and I do not have a single answer because first we are not talking about a homogeneous group as there is a tremendous heterogeneity among them And second I do not know if it is pertinent to discuss this here because it goes a little bit further from your question but I would say that in my experience newly arrived migrant women even if they are close to delivery have many things in their minds other than giving birth such as housing food clothing and education for their children Often migrant women tend to secure their families and kids first They become the pillars of their family in terms of organisation which is terribly difficult to accomplish because you usually have no money and on top of that you are pregnant you have other kids to look after or you are looking for a job or you have to go back to university because your degree is not valid here So just that is a burden itself and there are associated factors that may facilitate or complicate your job such as how well you master the language how well educated you are or even how familiar you are with the implicit tacit and invisible social rules Now thinking aloud while trying to organise my ideas I would say that the differences you see among these women turn around two main threads The reasons for coming to Canada including the country from where you are coming and the length of time these women have been living here So basically it s not the same when you come to Canada from the US or France and you planned it sometimes even as a family option than if you are coming as a refugee from a non Western country In the first case you are prepared to face certain challenges that you may have even anticipated because you have gone through similar things in your own country such as a job search whereas in the second case you are escaping from an abusive situation you are probably poor coming from a violent country and leaving behind traumatic stories of suffering repression In addition the language spoken in the receiving country has no similar roots not even the same alphabet the culture is completely different and as you did not anticipate coming here you are not necessarily prepared to face it winter is challenging So the truth is that in both cases you come looking for better options thinking that you are finally in a free and well organised country but you are not equipped to face the challenges This said the time living in Canada plays a crucial role because if you have been living here for a while sooner or later you get more acclimatised to the culture and you end up by getting into the system and your family s basic needs are already attended by then We see a big difference you know between the ones that are just arriving and the ones that are already established And again socio cultural integration which is a major issue depends on the circumstances that brought you here If you come from any country outside Canada another thing that has to be taken into account is the Canadian status with which you are entering the country So if you are for example a perm anent resident you may struggle to settle down but as you will navigate the legal side of the system your stuff will be moving quickly however if you do not have a Canadian status well you will have no rights at all they have literally nothing not even access to legal recourses because they cannot even claim for refugee status These people it s sad what I am going to say but they just live in the shadows in all possible senses And for migrant women who are pregnant the Canadian status is crucial because that opens or closes access to free health care If you have a Canadian status no matter which one you get access to care Now if you do not have access to health care no matter what you can come and deliver there is no question about it But they have to pay you know So we do not deal with them anymore just because the hospital now asks for money upfront for deliveries But we used to have undocumented immigrants a while ago not now Those people are still around but we do not see them because they have to pay for everything even for prenatal screenings But Oh Gosh They are around You know what I think the package they call it package or something I think it could be something like to deliver here If there is a chance of a caesarean section if they have to have an induction which lasts so many days if they are in pain and need an epidural that s extra I do believe Well this is what I am saying there are a lot of people that come here with no status and that means they have to pay the hospital and usually they do not have that money But they come here and they deliver We get caught there because the admin istration says We will charge these people and so they go out What happens after I do not know Where do they go after No idea but they do not have the money to pay and if they want to deliver they have to pay upfront But that is the case as it is everywhere around the world And there are other challenges besides access to the health care system Probably the most salient ones being the sociocultural beliefs the language and the availability of social support These three factors are crucial and are difficult to deal with from both sides I would even say I mean also for us Maybe it s me but I think that the sociocultural beliefs are the toughest ones because you may need proper language to ask for the appointments and you may count or not on some family or friends to explain to you how to get into the health care system unknown to you that s true But now when it comes to sociocultural issues it s really hard for them because in addition to not having the language and feeling isolated the only way you have to be emotionally linked to your family is by means of your rituals your traditions your beliefs And for different reasons usually genuine reasons we have a hard time to respect them The more typical ones are the need of the placenta to be planted burnt or eaten depending on different rituals and the request of having just female staff around them And we cannot please them with these requests because of the law and regulations First here in Quebec all sample materials extracted are saved here at the hospital for safety reasons so you may like it or not we cannot give you the placenta second because of gender equity and because this is a teaching hospital you will be appropriately served but by whoever is available And you sign for that when you come to deliver And the story does not end there No Once you understand how the system works and how to get into the system there is another whole package that is getting the same health care Canadian women get I think we are pretty spoiled here in Montreal because we live in a multicultural city but it may not be the case in other parts of Quebec So for example prejudices from health care professionals Well that s another issue Black people are always late Latinos are not able to be responsible and you keep on going So picture this a woman comes here speaks no English or French has her other two kids around her because she s not yet working so they do not go to daycare and her husband is working So she s not a priority because if she gets the care who is going to take care of the kids Just practical issues you know I frequently ask myself whether these prejudices are going to stop We tried education we trained some of our professionals on multicultural issues Well it minimised the negative impact but it is still there If there is a clue coming out from this study I would like to know what is it if there is anything else we can do that would be helpful to know So there s a huge clash between these women s culture and our health system We follow evidence and when you do not have the language or the experience you probably will not understand that we are doing it for your benefit I know You will say research evidence is mainly rooted in Western countries that s true I give that to you but that s so far what we have as a credible account So if I put myself in her shoes and yes they might feel we are pushing them sometimes Is there anything else I can say I do not think so I am pretty sure I covered the whole spectrum It s interesting because even myself I always think of these women as a final outcome as women coming for health care and as a health care professional I say to myself Just be fair and provide equal care Now you pushed me to think about this What is equal care Is it the same we give to everyone but does not respect these women s stories Or is it a different type of care we are talking about If this is it truly more than being guided by my intuition I really do not know what to do because there are so many factors conflating that I really do not know how to proceed Funny thing you know you came with your questions and now I have got some questions of my own Discussion In discussions held with health care professionals three main themes were identified and related to a women s start up conditions at the time of getting pregnant and or delivering the baby b challenges migrant women face regarding maternity care and c the relationship between Canadian standards of maternity care and women s experiences regarding pregnancy and delivery According to participants interviewed in this study maternity health care challenges newly arrived migrant women go through are varied and cannot be considered in a vacuum instead these challenges are part of a complex reality these women have to face The navigation of the health care system is itself challenging because of the complex interaction of factors related to the patient the health care professionals and the health care system as proposed in previous literature In addition these women are challenged by starting a new life in a new country e g mastering the official language spoken in the receiving country that depending on their personal and social experiences as well as contextual circumstances e g availability of interpreters may be or not addressed Most of the challenges these women face are due to social and health care inequities and these women s wellbeing is tightly associated to responding to these challenges from different perspectives i e individual and health care system level Comparisons showed no differences neither across the four identified cases nor between participants who were themselves migrants from non Western countries and participants who were non migrants Participants expressed their empathy towards migrant women s efforts to fit into the Canadian standards of maternity health care but at the same time they questioned women who refused to adopt or follow proposed standards of care due to sociocultural beliefs The participants agreed that it was key for migrant women to be acclimatised to the Canadian culture and to understand the health care system requirements Of interest the participants did not refer to women s demographic characteristics as health determinants but instead to how acculturation assimilation or integration described as closely related to the length of stay in the new country were crucial to these women to navigate both the social system and the health care system a finding already reported In line with previous research it seems that the health care professionals perceive the challenges migrant women go through but at the same time justify or reinforce the rules imposed by the health care system Another trend observed across given responses and represented in the vignette was that when participants showed more empathy and understanding towards women s circumstances they referred to them as you in a familiar way while talking to the interviewer whereas when they were pointing out aspects women should work on to fit Canadian standards of health care they were referring to these women as they creating a distance Building from previous evidence this seems to suggest that the standard norms underlying the medical culture are deeply ingrained in the health care system so that health care professionals assume medical standards as being unquestionable and perceive as outsider as those who are not aligned with these norms As illustrated in the vignette the description the participants used to present the events was not linear and instead unfolded across many different situations Participants fluctuated between perceiving migrant women as being in different circumstances and requiring different approaches to perceiving them as local people who might be familiar with the health care system and therefore be deserving of equal and standard health care Thus even when health care professionals may not necessarily contribute to health care inequities they may be reinforcing values deeply embedded and promoted in professional socialisation and training mainly based on Western predominant standards of health care Therefore medical interventions although well intended might not be responding to these women s needs instead they are likely to rely on health care professionals educational backgrounds in field experience professional ethical standards and in the support of the institution where they work e g explicit policies on how to proceed In an era of global migration understanding sociocultural clashes between health care professionals and migrants is crucial to address medical treatment undermined by both incomprehension and lack of agreement concerning the meaning of health among participants This seems to indicate that efforts towards reasonable accommodation of these women s unattended health care needs and mainstream culture are needed In this vein policies that translate these women s needs into concrete health care practices are crucial to the delivery of culturally safe care Our study has limitations First we conducted a single interview with each consenting participant However these interviews were in depth and were flexible enough to follow ideas participants brought up for discussion Data collection and analysis were therefore built around emerging ideas and not merely attached to previous evidence While it can be argued that only participants who have an interest in migrant populations might have consented to participate it should be noted that of the total potential participants invited to participate n = only five health care professionals contacted did not participate participation rate = In addition by qualitatively interviewing health care professionals the present study unveiled the voices of those who are actually in charge of medical practices a side little explored until now To better portray these voices we presented a detailed account of themes discussed and more importantly a first person vignette portraying common patterns we identified in health care professionals accounts that showed how personal and social factors identified in previous epidemiologic studies are intertwined and contribute to the creation of a complex process This evidence complements previous works in which language was found to be a crucial obstacle regarding migrant women s health care related experiences Future research in this area is promising because it aims at unveiling how professionals perceptions are translated into their practices Findings from our study offer a springboard for future research First while the consideration of factors related to different levels of responsibility is important it is also crucial to unveil how these factors interact Longitudinal research designs may facilitate both an understanding of how the process of acculturation by newly arrived migrant women influences a their use of maternity services and b health care professionals responses to these women s needs In addition research synthesis offer a clearer sense of newly arrived migrant women s journeys when looking for maternity care This information may contribute to the design of inter cultural interventions tailored for health care professionals including for example specific basic university education and once hired continuing education the creation of new policies and procedures and a space to discuss how available policies translate into interventions and tailored tools to appropriately intervene It would also be interesting to explore what barriers and facilitators health care professionals experience when working with migrant women and explore how these affect their practice In addition in this study we solely interviewed health care professionals so interviewing migrant women as well as other health care professionals such as midwives would help illuminating and understanding the phenomenon we described Notable midwives were not included in this sample because only few midwives attend births in hospitals moreover in Quebec midwives are not employees of the hospitals and are mainly work in birthing centres Conclusion According to health care professionals newly arrived migrant women face several challenges that go beyond maternity care and are difficult to address because they are deeply entangled with values and practices intrinsic to the health care system For this reason health care professionals might not be fully aware of all the challenges these women face and the health care system perpetuates Our study unveils that more efforts are needed to sensitise health care professionals to be more responsive to the maternity care needs and concerns of migrant women Although the underlying reason may be that colonial values ruling marginalisation are largely entrenched in the health care system as for today it seems that as portrayed by Moli√®re in the The Doctor in Spite of Himself more than years ago health care professionals have a power associated with their status that they can use to either dictate health or provide culturally safe health care services The question that still remains unanswered is how aware are health care professionals of the power they have in their hands Notes This work was presented at the North American Refugee Health Conference NARHC held in Toronto Canada Declarations

2632,2632,On Sunday Dec the Victorias Secret angels will strut down a majestic catwalk in nothing but glitter emblazoned bras and enormous fantastical wings trailing behind their backs The annual fashion show is arguably one of the most controversial events to date and recent comments from the lingerie company s chief marketing officer Ed Razek during an interview with Vogue about the models that Victoria s Secret looks for to represent the brand have stirred up a lot of ill feelings The most recent backlash comes from ThirdLoves co CEO Heidi Zak who wrote an open letter to Victorias Secret about inclusivity or I should say the brands lack thereof for The New York Times But before I dive into the heartfelt letter that Zak penned for Victoria s Secret lets backtrack for a sec Just in case youve somehow missed all the commotion Razek and VS executive vice president of public relations Monica Mitro recently sat down with Vogue to chat about the upcoming fashion show and what viewers can expect to see on the runway this year Without the slightest bit of hesitation Vogues director of runway Nicole Phelps was quick to ask whether or not Victoria s Secret had taken into consideration what the Instagram generation wants and expects from the brand when it comes to recruiting its angels In his response Razek explained that while VS does make an effort to be inclusive in the sizes it offers the brand isnt looking to televise women actually wearing those sizes at this time The conversation took a turn for the controversial when Phelps asked Razek and Mitro about whether or not VS feels the need to shift its image in a more progressive direction similar to how Rihannas Savage x Fenty NYFW runway show featured women of all shapes sizes sexual orientations and gender identities back in September If youre asking if weve considered putting a transgender model in the show or looked at putting a plus size model in the show we have Razek told Vogue Still as for the annual VS fashion show Razek made it very clear that viewers wont be seeing bigger sizes on the runway this year He told Vogue We invented the plus size model show in what was our sister division Lane Bryant Lane Bryant still sells plus size lingerie but it sells a specific range just like every specialty retailer in the world sells a range of clothing As do we We market to who we sell to and we dont market to the whole world We attempted to do a television special for plus sizes in No one had any interest in it still dont In terms of whether or not the brand has considered featuring transgender models in the annual fashion show Razek told Vogue it s just not happening this year He explained Its like why doesnt your show do this Shouldnt you have transsexuals in the show No No I dont think we should Well why not Because the show is a fantasy Its a minute entertainment special To say that these types of comments from Razek are distasteful would be an understatement at best so you can probably understand why Zak the co founder of ThirdLove an inclusive bra underwear and loungewear brand would feel so compelled to not only respond over social media but to pen a letter that would ultimately be printed as a full page ad in the Sunday Nov edition of The New York Times In the piece Zak addressed Victorias Secret directly asking how in this day and age a CMO of any company let alone one that is supposedly for women could make such statements Havent we moved beyond outdated ideas of femininity and gender roles she wrote She continued Were done with pretending certain sizes dont exist or arent important enough to serve And please stop insisting that inclusivity is a trend We believe the future is building a brand for every woman regardless of her shape size age ethnicity gender identity or sexual orientation This shouldnt be seen as groundbreaking it should be the norm Although Zak addressed her letter to Victorias Secret directly she was also speaking to a much larger more general audience women Lets listen to women Lets respect their intelligence Lets exceed their expectations Let women define themselves Zak wrote in her conclusion In order to overcome the often unrealistic body standards set forth by companies like Victoria s Secret Zak said the solution is to support the brands that in turn support us as women like ThirdLove To all women everywhere we see you and we hear you Zak wrote Your reality is enough To each her own Following Razek s comments Zak wasn t the only one who took to social media to speak out about the Victoria s Secret Fashion Show s lack of diversity and the CMO s eyebrow raising interview with Vogue Celebrities like Tess Holliday Rihanna and even Kendall Jenner have all reacted to the controversial statements in their own subtle ways on social media according to PEOPLE In response to the backlash on Nov Razek issued an apology over Twitter The statement said My remark regarding the inclusion of transgender models in the Victoria s Secret Fashion Show came across as insensitive I apologize To be clear we absolutely would cast a transgender model for the show We have had transgender models come to castings And like many others they did not make it But it was never about gender I admire and respect their journey to embrace who they really are The time for change is now but unfortunately it looks like you and I will have to wait until next year s annual VS fashion show to know for sure whether or not the responses to and critiques of Razek and VS alike will make an impact on the brand s direction for
7388,7388,"I'll add about hair color. I've had many compliments on my hair color for many years. This seems odd to me, since it's not professionally done. But I've been stopped in stores by other women, asking for my hair color. Just recently, a man passing by me said I had beautiful hair. I color my own hair. This means I can do it at any time and whether I have a budget issue or not. I spend maybe $30 a year on hair color? I even use my own tools (a clean toothbrush I cut & modified for applying color). I use only a few tablespoons of color mixed with equal amt of peroxide, so one box of color lasts a while. Home hair color is gentler, IMO. This of course means it fades more quickly. For me, that's a good thing. As it fades, I get strands of lighter 's not necessary to spend a fortune on hair coloring. I've done it at home for decades, using inexpensive color, but those that damage the hair the least. I used to use the cheapo Clairol Balsam. It was discontinued, so I'm using Nice N'Easy color right now. I have a procedure I developed over the years. If you want tips on hair coloring, you can do a separate post on that. Although I'm over 60, I have long straight hair, all one length. It's shiny, with tiny highlights & dark lights. I wish I had wavy, fuller hair, but I've learned not to fight what I naturally have. I don't mind if I have a gray strand that shows here and there. But the hair color generally will be a slightly different shade on the gray strands than on my naturally darker brown strands, IF the color isn't too dark. The trick to natural color, I think, is to stay within your natural color family, only a tad lighter & with very subtle highlights."

lives today I m your host and personal mythologistCatherine Svehla Wherever you may be in this wide beautiful crazy world of ours you are part of this story circle Well friends here we are two weeks later and there s a lot of talk now about the fact that the world has ended Many people saying that the world has ended there s no going back and everything has changed That is probably largely true True of the world that humans have created of our world of institutions and mechanisms andconcepts and ideas And yet the world that is the earth the source the origin the ground she s here The spring flowers are blooming here in the desert The sun is still rising and setting The stars are still in the sky When I take my morning walks I find myself repeating these words from the poet Mary Oliver Tell me about despair yours and I will tell you mine Meanwhile the world goes on Well April is National Poetry Month here in the United States andtoday I have a handful of poems that I want to share with you poems that speak of the world and its constancy of the beauty and the belonging and of the sustenance that is available now to you to each of us in the earth and her generosity and in poems that can be a portal into remembering that wealth So I m going to read each one of the poems twice just to give us a better chance to sink into that space And I will post links to these poets with the transcript of this podcast on my mythic mojo website Without further ado I invite you to relax and listen and let the sound of the words as much of the meaning take you someplace peaceful This first poem is The Mystery of Meteors by Eleanor Lerman and if that name sounds familiar it s because I shared her poem Starfish with my email subscribers last November around Thanksgiving The Mystery of Meteors by Eleanor Lerman from The Mystery of Meteors I am out before dawn marching a small dog through a meager park Boulevards angle away newspapers fly around like blind white birds Two days in a row I have not seen the meteors though the radio news says they are overhead Leonid s brimstones are barred by clouds I cannot read the signs in heaven I cannot see night rendered into fire And yet I do believe a net of glitter is above me You would not think I still knew these things I get on the train I buy the food I sweep discuss considergloves or boots and in the summer open windows find beads to string with pearls You would not think that I had survived anything but the life you see me living now In the darkness the dog stops and sniffs the air She has been alone she has known danger and so now she watches for it always and I agree with the conviction off my mistakes But in the second part of my life slowly slowly I begin to counsel bravery Slowly slowly I begin to feel the planets turning and I am turning toward the crackling shower of their sparks These are the mysteries I could not approach when I was younger the boulevards themeteors the deep desires that split the sky walking down the paths of the cold park I remember myself the one who can wait out anything So I cautionthe dog to go silently to bear with me the burden of knowing what spins on and on above our heads For this is our reward Come Armageddon come fire or flood come love not love millennia of portents there is a future in which the dog and I are laughing Born into it the mystery I know we will be saved A Blessing by James Wright Just off the highway to Rochester Minnesota Twilight bounds softly forth on the grass And the eyes of those two Indian ponies Darken with kindness They have come gladly out of the willows To welcome my friend and me We step over the barbed wire into the pasture Where they have been grazing all day alone They ripple tensely they can hardly contain their happiness That we have come They bow shyly as wet swans They love each other There is no loneliness like theirs At home once more They begin munching the young tufts of spring in the darkness I would like to hold the slenderer one in my arms For she has walked over to me And nuzzled my left hand She is black and white Her mane falls wild on her forehead And the light breeze moves me to caress her long ear That is delicate as the skin over a girl s wrist Suddenly I realize that if I stepped out of my body I would break Into blossom Gift by Czeslaw Milosz from New and Collected Poems A day so happy Fog lifted early I worked in the garden Hummingbirds were stopping over honeysuckle flowers There was no thing on earth I wanted to possess I knew no one worth my envying him Whatever evil I had suffered I forgot To think that once I was the same man did not embarrass me In my body I felt no pain When straightening up I saw the blue sea and sails By the Mango Trees by W S Merwin from Finding the Islands A little higher the green hill hides in rain The trees bow with the wind but the houses forget Rain on the tin roof lizard hands on the tin ceiling listening In the evening sunlight the hill pasture is ripening Lizard just hatched such a hurry tail gets in front of the head A spider hangs from a new thread in the light from the window Lizard runs out on a beam shits and looks down White balsamflowers moons in fullmoonlight Lateat night the dogs bark for hours then the rain comes Greatdipper stands on its handle leaning against the paling sky When the rooster crows a rat shakes the orange tree Old dry banana leaf one of my aunts butI can t remember which Loud yellow truck passes the yellow lilies in the wind Living at the farm she airs her baby up and down the road How time disappears while we live under the big tree A little change of pace here with Billy Collins This poem is called The Order of the Day from Aimless Love A morning after a week of rain and the sun shot down through the branches into the tall bare windows The brindled cat rolled over on his back and I could hear you in the kitchen grinding coffee beans into a powder Everything seemed especially vivid because I knew we were all going to die first the cat then you than me then somewhat later the liquefied sun was the order I was envisioning But then again you never really know The cat had a fiercely healthy look his coat so bristling and electric I wondered what you had been feeding him and what you had been feeding me as I turned a corner and beheld you out there on the sunny deck lost in exercise running in place knees lifted high skin glistening and that toothy immortal looking smile of yours Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird by Wallace Stevens Amongtwentysnowy mountains The only moving thing Was the eye of the blackbird I was of three minds Like a tree In which there are three blackbirds The black bird whirledin the autumn winds It was a small part of the pantomime A man and a woman Are one A man and a woman and a blackbird Are one I do not know which to prefer The beauty of inflections Or the beauty of innuendos The blackbird whistling Or just after Icicles filled the long window With barbaric glass The shadow of the blackbird Crossedit toandfro The mood Traced in the shadow Anindecipherable cause Oh thin menof Haddam Why do you imaginegolden birds Do you not see how the black bird Walks around the feet Of the women about you I know noble accents And lucid inescapable rhythms But I know too That the blackbird is involved In what I know When the black bird flew out of sight It marked the edge Of one of many circles At the sight of black birds Flying in a green light Even the bawds ofeuphony Would cry out sharply He rode over Connecticut Ina glass coach Once a fear pierced him Inthat he mistook The shadow of his equipage For blackbirds The river is moving The black bird must be flying It was evening all afternoon It was snowing And it was going to snow The black bird sat In the cedar limbs Next I want to read a poem titled As By Eavan Boland I really like this poem because Boland speaks about those two worlds the world ofthe earth and the world that we have constructed on top of it And I m going to read this in the hope that it might also lend some sense to theexperiment that I have proposed to you in the last couple of podcasts I m not going torepeat the detailsagain so if you don t know what I m talking about go listen to the last couple of podcasts for details aboutthis experiment of being with something in the world I think it s kind of synchronisticthat Idiscovered this poem recently while I myself have been practicing that little experiment As by Eavan Boland from A Woman Without A Country Asqueak of light Ocean air looking to come inland to test its influence on the salty farms waking Mist lifts The distance reappears In an hour so someone will saycrystal clear even though there is no truth in itsince even now the

long and warm The branch of one tree angles to its own heaviness While everywhere everywhere it continues language crossing the impossible with the proverbial until no one any longer wants a world where as is not preferred to its absence Nor a fiddle not fit nor awhistlenot clean nor rain not right again I am walking home A quartermoon rises in the white beams At the next turnhouses appear mine among them I walkpast leaves grass one bicycle I put my key in the lock In a little while I will say safe as If you have a habit of writing yourself I hope that you are indulging it While it may seem trivial or your reflections may seem too small or ordinary to matter I have a sense that what we re noticing about this time about our response to it and about the world both worlds all worlds is very important It is certainly part of the raw material of the making of something new I d like to read a poem for you by David Whyte that somehow captures a little bit of that spirit for me of being both small and also necessary to some great story that is in the making in the moment Mameen and this is by David Whyte from River Flow Be infinitesimal under that sky a creature even thesailing hawk misses a wraith among the rocks where the miss part slowly Recall the way mere mortals are overwhelmed by circumstance how great reputations dissolvewith infirmity and how you in particular live a hairsbreadth from losing everyone you holddear Then look back down the path as if seeing your past and then south over the hazy blue coast as if present to a wide future Remember the way you are all possibilities you can see and how you live best as an appreciator of horizons whether you reach them or not Admit that once you have got up from your chair and opened the door once you have walked out into the clean air toward that edge and taken the path up high beyond the ordinary you have become the privileged and the pilgrim the one who will tell the story and the one coming back from the mountain who helped to make it I have long admired the poet Pat Mora and I recently got a book of her poems titled Chants I d like to read one of these to you as a way of sharing my love for my particular corner of theearth which is the Mojave Desert a place that has an inexplicable hold on my heart and my spirit Mora describes a wayof being with the desert in such beautiful language that I can t resist reading this one to you It s called Curandera by Pat Mora from Chants They think she lives alone on the edge of town in a two room house where she moved when her husband died at thirty five of a gunshot wound in the bed of another woman The curandera and the house have aged together to the rhythm of the desert She wakes early lights candles before her sacred statues brews tea of yerbabuena She moves down her porch steps rubs cool morning sand into her hands into her arms Like a large black bird she feeds on the desert gathering herbs for her basket Her days are slow days of grinding dried snake into powder of crushing wild bees to mix with white wine And the townspeople come hoping to be touched by her ointments her hand her prayers her eyes She listens to their stories and she listens to the desert always to the desert By sunset she s tired The wind strokes the strands of long gray hair the smell of drying plants drifts into her blood the sun seeps into her bones She dozes on her back porch Rocking rocking At night she cooks chopped cactus and brews more tea She brushes a layer of sand from her bed sand which covers the table stove floor She blows the statues clean the candles out Before sleeping she listens to the message of the owl and the coyote She closes her eyes and breathes with the mice and snakes and wind Poetry can be a portal to a particular reflective space a space that I feel it s very important for us to visit right now I d like to share more poetry with you in future podcasts and I want to invite you to send me a poem that you would like to hear as part of a podcast Or better yet record yourself reading a poem Email me the recording and I will include it as part of a podcast If you are willing and I certainly hope that some of you are send me a recording of yourself reading a poem and I will include it as part of the podcast Terry Tempest Williams says Your voice is the wildest thing that you own Your voice is the wildest thing that you own and when so many of us are locked down and closed in and feeling like our world is very small now is the time to call in our wildness That is an essential ingredient in this making that I am referring to and voice voice my friends is an important part of it So share yours Pick a poem that holds meaning for you right now It doesn t have to be original Record yourself reading it You can record it on your phone and email it to me If you go to the Mythic Mojo website you will find the email address I will include your name in the podcast unless you tell me that you prefer to be

Dream Work You do not have to be good You do not have to walk on your knees for a hundred miles through the desert repenting You only have to let the soft animal of your body love what it loves Tell me about despair yours and I will tell you mine Meanwhile the world goes on Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain are moving across the landscapes over the prairies and the deep trees the mountains and the rivers Meanwhile the wild geese high in the clean blue air are heading home again Whoever you are no matter how lonely the world offers itself to your imagination Calls to you like the wild geese harsh and exciting over and over announcing your place in the family of things And that s it for me Catherine Svehla and Myth Matters I invite you to email me with your comments

10726,10726,"Some Maskne tips: make sure you wash your cloth masks in fragrance free, dye free laundry detergent & skip the fabric softener. These can leave residues behind on the fabric that are irritating to the skin. Make sure to choose masks with a smooth fabric lining and no bunchy seams, as rough surfaces create a lot of friction on the skin that can wear away the skin barrier. A layer of sunscreen that contains zinc or titanium can help your skin by serving as a barrier against any friction or irritation that develops. ://"

8406,8406,Day Nourishing I chose this Lamy Cosmetics Real Rice Paper Eating Mask Pack Tumeric since I figured rice and tumeric both sounded nourishing from the name The mask is a different set up than the usual sheetmask so I recapped it on my story Price Received from the amazingggg The price online seems to vary a lot by site and seller I have seen it range anywhere from sounds a bit ridiculous imo so I do not really have a price estimate for this mask Fit This is my first two piece mask I found the rice paper hard to manipulate think like the slightly thicker version of a spring roll wrapper and it did not really fold down to fit my face shape Now that I think about it I probably could ve ripped the mask to fit since I already accidentally ripped it while putting it on Scent When I opened the package there was a rice smell to it but the essence itself is pretty floral Use I followed the instructions and poured the essence packet into the mask tray to soak for a couple minutes There were a few places that did not soak entirely so I just kind pushed it down with my finger Be careful lifting the mask up I ripped the mask a bit both times despite being super careful the second time It s also fairly drippy since the rice paper does not hold as much liquid as a cotton sheet mask I had to put it on over the sink and rubbed the remaining essence on my arms and legs The mask stayed on my face for about minutes before it started falling off my face on its own so I just took it off Essence was absorbed quickly into my skin Overall This was a fun experience but I need to get better at putting it on My big downside to the mask was that there was way more essence in the packet than what could be absorbed by the mask

8414,8414,AS was true when I wrote my March blog post I m not sure if I should write about Covid s tragic hold on humanity or pivot to my sense of humor a valuable distraction from the constant stream of bad news I ve decided to do both I cannot ignore the virus s tragedies Nor can I shut off what seems to be my fail safe weapon against fear and impending danger my ability to perceive grains of humor however dark that are entwined in sadness On April th I checked into Facebook and read that two of my FB friends had tested positive for the virus Those words tested positive roared through my mind with the fury of a monster once thought to have been defeated now returning to claim its revenge Every LGBTQ person who lived through the scourge of AIDS recalls those words sometimes whispered other times shouted always dreaded In the early days of that plague positive was the most negative and feared word one could hear It meant suffering and an almost certain death Then as now we were counseled about changing behaviors that promoted the spread of the disease Then as now cities populations changed Provincetown s gay male citizenry shrank The character of San Francisco s Castro District dimmed New York City s and London s Soho neighborhoods lost their brilliance as AIDS erased the artists writers actors musicians and ordinary people who d found safe harbor there As was true then the pulse of the Arts continues to beat Equally true is the presence of irony Ironies abound in the Covid situation Isn t the phrase social distancing an oxymoron Humor lurks within these ironies and humor inspired laughter keeps my mood above water With that in mind what follows is my attempt to lighten your thoughts if only for a moment Some of my comments include references to people known more by the members of my generation the Baby Boomers than by the younger readers of this blog For the sake of those younger readers I ll place an asterisk next to the names of the oldies Smokey Robinson is was a song writer producer from Detroit Motown He is was the lead singer of the Miracles One of the group s songs less popular than Ooh Baby Baby was I Gotta Dance to Keep from Crying I ve changed dance to laugh and let the lyric become my daily earworm always ready to pop into my head when I m listening to CNN or MSNBC broadcasts Hence I lean on Smokey and the Miracles several times each day My age demographic suggests I could be one of the virus s prime targets So is completing the Census Form a waste of my time Remember the question that concluded every episode of The Lone Ranger Who was that masked man If you heard that question today you d be able to answer It s everybody Of course the L R didn t wear an anti virus mask and Tonto had absolutely no protective gear That figures doesn t it Maybe the moment has arrived for me to read Albert Camus La Peste The Plague Once in the early days of social distancing I was in the market s cereal aisle and I watched a man move away from me quickly Stunned by his speedy retreat and knowing I hadn t pulled the pin from a hand grenade I started to yell Is it something I said or at your age are you ashamed you re buying Fruit Loops As my lovely spouse finished trimming my hair she examined me closely and asked Who says everything has to be symmetrical I know it s a good idea to stay busy So by now I ve detailed the toaster cleaned each window sill using Q tips dipped in Simple Green vacuumed our two kitties cleaned each window on the inside and outside using my breath and old newspapers soaked and scrubbed my little eyeglass cleaner cloths and hung them on a clothesline I rigged up in the basement BTW rubber coated paper clips are an excellent substitute for clothes pins Every Wednesday night I can hardly sleep because I m so excited about going to the supermarket on Thursday morning during the senior hours six to eight A M Every Thursday morning at ten o clock I fall asleep while I m reading the newspaper The six A M trip to the market exhausts me Pulling up to the bank s drive thru window and wearing a mask while black makes me a tad jumpy I m going to organize a group activity for my neighbors Some evening we can all stand outside in front of our respective homes and play Whispering Down the Lane Of course we ll have to shout at each other so what s the point The day following our neighborhood whisper shout game I plan to phone my financial adviser and ask for her advice about investing in hearing aid companies Bored between cleaning tasks I ve resumed answering every single phone call even the ones identified as spam I love how the robot keeps talking no matter what insults I scream into the telephone In violation of practicing social distancing and wearing protective masks protesters have taken to the streets They want to return to work where they ll be able to become infected or infect others Let s ask them how they re feeling fourteen days from now okay Written evidence suggests that the D C idiot received briefings and memos about Covid in time to make life saving plans He dismissed the information and continued playing golf The ultimate irony of all of this would be his re

1998,1998,Genes NutritionStudying the relationship between genetics and nutrition in the improvement of human health201712 Abstract The complex physiology of living organisms represents a challenge for mechanistic understanding of the action of dietary bioactives in the human body and of their possible role in health and disease Animal cell and microbial models have been extensively used to address questions that could not be pursued experimentally in humans posing an additional level of complexity in translation of the results to healthy and diseased metabolism The past few decades have witnessed a surge in development of increasingly sensitive molecular techniques and bioinformatic tools for storing managing and analyzing increasingly large datasets Application of such powerful means to molecular nutrition research led to a major leap in study designs and experimental approaches yielding experimental data connecting dietary components to human health Scientific journals bear major responsibilities in the advancement of science As primary actors of dissemination to the scientific community journals can impose rigid criteria for publishing only sound reliable and reproducible data Journal policies are meant to guide potential authors to adopt the most updated standardization guidelines and shared best practices Such policies evolve in parallel with the evolution of novel approaches and emerging challenges and therefore require constant updating We highlight in this manuscript the major scientific issues that led to formulating new updated journal policies for Genes Nutrition a journal which targets the growing field of nutritional systems biology interfacing personalized nutrition and preventive medicine with the ultimate goal of promoting health and preventing or treating disease We focus here on relevant issues requiring standardization in nutrition research We also introduce new sections on human genetic variation and nutritional bioinformatics which follow the evolution of nutritional science into the twenty first century Keywords Introduction The intensity and pace of modern science has accelerated at a breath taking speed since the start of the modern genome era circa High throughput omics technologies have been applied to experimental designs and analytical methods based on reductionism and population averages the normal scientific strategies of the late twentieth and early twenty first centuries However results produced under the current research model are unable to explain the complexity of biological processes Nevertheless the foundation of knowledge created during the post genomic era justifies a paradigm shift in how biomedical research needs to be conducted to understand how to maintain health and prevent or treat disease Genes Nutrition G N not only recognizes this scientific evolution but also plays a key role in promoting high quality research in the trans disciplinary fields linking nutrition environment genetics and human health by setting high standards for studies accepted for publication The tenth anniversary of G N provided an opportunity not only to restate our mission but also to announce new guidelines for manuscripts submitted to this journal based on the significant advances in biomedical research in the past two decades Genes Nutrition was the recipient of many such advances and disseminated new ideas and results to the nutrition research community Relevant examples are cited in the text below Mission Genes Nutrition is an international inter disciplinary peer review journal for research on the relationship between genetics and nutrition with the ultimate goal of providing knowledge for improving human health Since its inception in G N has seen a steady increase in readership reflected in a credible impact factor that has recently resulted in its inclusion into the BioMed Central BMC family of free access journals In parallel with regular publications the editorial team has stimulated readers involvement through editorials and commentaries position papers e g project ideas e g literature highlights e g as well as novel formulas leaving the authors a space for freely debating their opinions on the most provocative scientific issues relevant to the aims and scope of the journal e g Our overall goal is to contribute to shaping the identity of the growing field of nutritional systems biology interfacing personalized nutrition and preventive medicine which started blooming within the molecular nutrition community in the twenty first century Guidelines standards and reproducibility of scientific data and findings The application of advanced genomics technologies to nutrition nutrigenomics provides foundational knowledge for advancing nutrient health associations for analysis of underlying mechanisms High throughput omics technologies are increasingly used to identify the often intertwined pathways of nutrient dependent modulation of gene expression at the gene protein metabolite levels and or epigenomic modifications towards mechanistic understanding of nutrient driven molecular processes at the system level Similar to all other fields of science applying such tools successful outcome of sensitive molecular approaches requires a high degree of standardization at all levels of the experimental process to limit confounders to a minimum and enable testing for reproducibility thus avoiding generation of conflicting results Genes Nutrition has been frontline in requesting standardization of data tools and services With this Editorial we wish to endorse the agreed Principles and Guidelines for Reporting Preclinical Research training rigor reproducibility principles guidelines reporting preclinical research jointly issued by major scientific journals to support scientific rigor and reproducibility In addition to standard requirements for human ethics and animal welfare we highlight here the minimal requirements of our specific journal regarding standardization of nutritional studies building and expanding on the shared policies of BMC Journals which request compliance to widely accepted guidelines Table Table Acronym Human genetic data Genes Nutrition was among the first specialty journals to focus on studies of the effects of nutrients on the expression of genetic information in humans and how genetic makeup alters the metabolism of nutrients Perhaps no area of modern biomedical research has progressed as rapidly and contributed as profoundly as the analysis of genome sequence and structure The NCBI list of completely or nearly completed sequenced genomes shows eukaryotes plant and animal prokaryotes viruses plasmids and organelle DNAs accessed October The production of sequence data has far outpaced the ability to understand how genetic makeup influences phenotype or responds to nutrition and other environmental factors Linking genetic loci that co segregate with the trait within families i e linkage analysis proved highly successful using DNA molecular markers rev in Over human monogenic diseases were identified by the year Exome and whole genome sequencing WGS can now identify rare deleterious mutations in individuals and comparison to parents or siblings enriches the chances of linking phenotype to genotype Although called monogenic disease the age of disease onset its severity and time to outcome all differ between individuals carrying the same mutation demonstrating that other genes play a role disease etiology e g in reality no phenotype is produced by a single gene except for those that are embryonically lethal Exome and WGS have produced an additional surprise any person s genome typically contains ~ genuine loss of function variants generating about completely inactivated genes Such mutations may be phenotypically silent in the heterozygote the Exome Aggregation Consortium ExAC analyzed human exomes and discovered each genome contains ~ variants reported as disease causing with ~ occurring at > frequency in populations In addition this consortium found that of variants classified as pathogenic were benign or probably benign Candidate gene and genome wide association studies GWAS utilize the same molecular technology as linkage studies to identify single nucleotide variants SNVs associated with complex diseases using a population based as opposed to a family based design Thousands of GWA studies have been published associating one or more single nucleotide variants to ~ phenotypes that include disease diet intake metabolism anthropometry pharmacogenomics and brain related disorders Over trait SNP associations at p value ‚â§ √ó ‚àí have been amassed as of and The majority of these SNP trait associations have small effect sizes and the sum of all variants identified for a trait explains only a small proportion of the phenotype Explaining the missing or phantom heritability has forced a re evaluation of the assumptions and strategies of GWAS designs Table describes some of the factors that influence genetic associations with phenotypes such as disease or response to diet We recognize that few if any human research studies can incorporate all of these variables However interpretations of results must be tempered when relying on analysis of single omic or independent datasets Table Missing heritability and the limitations of genome wide and candidate gene association studies Limitation Epistatic Interactions Association studies analyze a single variable e g SNP with a trait GWAS correct each SNP for multiple comparisons Well documented in animal models with increasing numbers of examples in humans Accounting for interactions decreased the amount of missing heritability New analytical methods are being developed to test for interactions Ascertainment bias Many phenotypes such as type diabetes or obesity were poorly characterized For example analysis of NHANES data demonstrated that body mass index was poorly associated with markers of cardiometabolic health Not limited to GWAS Gene environment interactions All organisms have genetic variation producing phenotypic variation in response to environmental factors this is the basis of natural selection High density genotyping exome and whole genome sequencing have proved that each genome differs from all others Adaptation to local environments has produced selection of gene variants e g lactase persistence in Europe Africa and part of the Mideast and selection for metabolizing high fat diets in Greenland Inuits Experimental systems have demonstrated gene diet interactions but as with SNP disease studies the effect size is small Epigenetics An epigenetic trait is a stably heritable phenotype resulting from changes in a chromosome without alterations in the DNA sequence Although not measured in most association studies DNA methylation and chromatin modifications alter the expression of genetic information differentially in each tissue Parent of origin genomic imprinting also alters gene regulation G N receives many manuscripts that describe statistically significant associations of a single nucleotide variable with a complex trait such as obesity or response to a nutrient or diet In almost all cases the effect size is not reported and the studies are done in one population In view of the limitations of SNV association studies which are similar to those of GWAS G N will publish manuscripts associating one or two SNPs in one to several genes only when the effect size is reasonably high and conducted in more than one population We encourage the use of classical statistical analysis of group differences when appropriate e g by sex age but also systems approaches to both experimental designs and methods for data analysis Designing human population cohort studies Risk factors calculated from population studies most simply derived by comparing some measureable phenotype between control versus case or intervention are the average risk for the population specifically population attributable risk PAR Using an example from genetics the PAR means that the incidence of a given disease or phenotype would change if the SNP or allele was eliminated in the population Hence PARs should not be considered as personal risk factors Unfortunately this important distinction is frequently disregarded Given the limitations of randomized clinical trials RCTs case intervention and cohort studies for nutrition research see new experimental designs are needed to develop individual risk or benefit factors based on predictor variables from human clinical studies N of studies are emerging as an experimental approach that first characterizes and then sorts individuals with similar metabolic profiles e g While characterization and clustering can be done with baseline data the response to acute challenges e g mixed meal or short term e g weeks interventions may be more informative given the variability in homeostasis between individuals Each individual serves as her his own control which eliminates ascertainment bias This approach was first used in psychology studies and then applied to clinical research A trivial example is to compare individual male versus female or groups of males and females although discovery based algorithms e g machine learning may identify metabolic clusters based on all available data without a priori grouping A number of n of studies have been published including proposals to better define exactly how these studies should be conducted Since these concepts and approaches are not well tested G N will consider publishing results of studies analyzing individuals or groups identified by various clustering methods as long as the design can be justified and the results robust Women s health research The US government passed the National Institute of Health Revitalization Act in that required women and minorities to be included in federally funded clinical studies with exceptions only when justified Women had been largely excluded from many health research studies as a protective measure against unintended harm to the individual and her fetus Significant differences have been measured in a large number of biochemical and physiological systems that are consistent with sex specific genetic profiles These dissimilarities are in addition to the metabolic changes caused by exposure to hormones during the menstrual cycle and changes in hormone levels during pregnancy and lactation Circulating levels of progesterone and estrogen are lowest during the early follicular phase when differences between a male and a female are probably least affected by hormone levels The result of sexual dimorphisms in metabolite levels particularly in response to hormonal variations may lead to biased nutritional recommendations for men and women of all age groups While a review of sexual dimorphic differences between sexes is beyond the scope of this editorial we also highlight the increasing awareness that fluctuating hormone levels during the menstrual cycle alter for example macronutrient metabolism metabolic profiles cardiometabolic markers lipid kinetics and the immune cell repertoire A recent review of articles winnowed by specific criteria from found a lack of consistency in determining the menstrual phase between studies and recommended the use of one of the six methods to assess cycle phase Recognizing that many existing systems nutrition studies will not have considered the menstrual cycle in comparing physiological and metabolic differences between males and females new studies that adopt one of these methods to assess menstrual cycle phase will improve interpretation and reproducibility of results Animal genetics Many research studies in nutrition and toxicology relied on outbred mice to better reflect the structure of the population and translatability to humans e g The use of outbred animals makes it difficult to appropriately power the experiment In addition maintaining a truly outbred population in breeding facilities is a significant challenge A distinct advantage of laboratory animals is the ability to develop inbred strains of defined genetic makeup Mouse fanciers in Asia bred mice for coat color at least since the s Researchers began using mice to study Mendelian inheritance patterns in the early s when they began inbreeding mice first for coat color and subsequently for susceptibility to disease The limitation of using inbred animals is that each strain is genetically unique often producing measurably different metabolic developmental or behavioral phenotypes The Jackson Laboratory maintains not only a resource for mouse genetic data but also phenotypic data based on its own in house and published research results Genetic variation can be incorporated into experiments by using several parental inbred strains and comparing physiological or transcriptomic responses A more recent development in analyzing complex traits was the creation of hybrid mouse diversity panel HMDP The HMDP consists of about inbred strains generated from parental inbred strains e g BALB c C57BL plus ~ recombinant inbred mice e g C57BL √ó DBA The combination of inbreeding these strains is to provide high resolution mapping of genetic loci DNA from many of these strains has been sequenced and all have been densely genotyped The HMDP strains have substantial variation in metabolic phenotypic traits and disease susceptibilities with differential responses to changes in diet e g which will allow for identifying interacting genes and gene environment interactions Data from studies involving the HMDP and some complementary human data can be accessed at the systems genetics resource Given the variability in phenotypes based on genetics G N will require strain designations and their commercial source for all studies Animal diets The complexity of diet compositions is widely acknowledged and yet the use of standard chow diets for nutritional studies in laboratory animals is common Different lots of chow diets vary in chemical composition with the best known examples being fatty acid composition and estrogenic isoflavones Mice fed different lots of chow have significantly different patterns of gene expression confounding the ability to replicate gene diet as well as microbiome studies Ricci and Ulman principals of Research Diets Inc New Brunswick NJ have developed what should be a simple meme for writing descriptions of animal diets Can I report it can I tell others exactly what my animals were fed Can I repeat it is there diet variability and will I be able to get the same results next year Can I revise it as my hypotheses change can I easily change the dietary components while keeping it otherwise matched to previous diets The American Institute of Nutrition created the semi purified AIN93A diet in with revisions for growth pregnancy and lactation AIN93G and adult maintenance AIN93M in Semi purified refers to the use of defined sources of carbohydrate vitamins minerals protein source and other essential nutrients plus dietary lipids in the form of corn coconut soy or other plant based oils e g The chemical composition of an oil is also likely to vary depending upon the source and lot The BIOCLAIMS project published a modified AIN93 diet in Genes Nutrition that improved the essential fatty acid composition polyunsaturated to saturated fat ratio > and use of oils without polyphenols or carotenes While these semi purified component diets are standardized chemical manipulations can be accommodated if nutrient to calorie ratios are maintained In line with the effort of ensuring reproducibility and scientific rigor G N requests authors to provide the full composition not only of experimental diets but also of the control standard diet employed in intervention studies on animal models When sourced from commercial entities the diet composition should be accompanied by the company name and diet identifier Peripheral blood mononuclear cell PMBC analysis Analyzing gene nutrient interactions in humans is challenging because most human tissues cannot be sampled In contrast peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs are easily obtained and pose no ethical barrier for most ages and conditions The accessibility of these primary cells for studies of transcriptomic and DNA methylation analysis in response to diet and other environmental factors is highly tempting PBMCs however are a highly diverse ecosystem The mouse Immunological Genome Project ImmGen estimates that blood contains more than types of cells and similar diversity likely exists in humans The number of these different PBMC types varies depending on the immunological status of the animal which would be defined by host and microbiome genome interactions and their combined interactions with environmental factors Although this consortium has yet to analyze RNA or DNA methylation levels in response to diet they reported that of PBMC transcripts differed by more than twofold across inbred mouse reflecting the influence of genetic background on gene expression Isolation procedures for distinct subsets of PBMC have been described e g and methods have been developed to deconvolute PBMC expression and DNA methylation profiles to albeit large functional subgroups of cells Arguments that transcriptomic or methylation profiles can be used as markers of disease or response to diet or other environmental influences are subject to the same criticism Hence G N will only publish PBMC transcriptomics or DNA methylation studies with semi purified cells or analyzed by methods that correlate experimental data with typical complete blood count CBC Cell line authentication Scientific progress in biomedical including nutrition research was immensely boosted several decades ago by the introduction of in vitro cell models Cell lines of mammalian origin are now available from almost all tissues but genotypic and phenotypic changes have been described to occur in most of them over time passage Different laboratories may have no or different quality control procedures and hence the same cell lines may differ significantly The authentication and purity of cell lines are often undervalued by many researchers who are frequently not aware of specific standards and guidelines and Major cell repositories should be the first to carry out unique identification of deposited cell lines and the source of a cell line should always accompany the name identifier in published papers Alignment to good cell culture practices published by the International Cell Line Authentication Committee is a prerequisite read for successful use of mammalian cell models in all branches of biomedical research Funding agencies and scientific journals are increasingly requesting authors for proofs of cell line authentication Adherence to standardized terminology in the naming of cell lines is explicitly requested to journals and consequently to the authors A high proportion of manuscripts received by Genes Nutrition employ stable cell lines to investigate nutrient dependent modulation of metabolic pathways in different tissues To ensure reproducibility and reliability of research results and in line with the policies adopted by major scientific journals NIH Rigor and Reproducibility Principles and Guidelines for Reporting Preclinical Research and Endorsement by major journals training rigor reproducibility principles guidelines reporting preclinical research manuscripts submitted to G N should report the source authentication and contamination testing in the Materials and Methods section performed according to widely accepted international guidelines and references therein Studies involving human embryonic stem cells must meet not only these exacting research standards but also ethical and legal standards applicable to all human research experiments An international compilation of human research standards is available from the Office of Human Research Protections of the US Department of Health and Human Services Microbiome The use of high throughput sequence technologies spurred the study of the microbiomes that live in and on humans and other organisms Many investigators have studied the gut microbial community because of the obvious involvement in gastrointestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease The microbial ecosystem however plays a key role in metabolizing and producing nutrients e g modulating the immune system and producing signaling molecules affecting the gut brain axis A primer for researchers for conducting a microbiome study has recently been published and refinements in standards are likely to be developed as this field matures Natural bioactives Disease prevention and treatment using natural products and their analogs has a long and rich history in Eastern and Western medicine The quest for and application of bioactive extracts and purified chemical substances of nutritional interest from both herbal and animal origin is attracting increasing attention among clinical and basic science investigators e g An expanding focus of this research is aimed at elucidating the mechanism of action of natural compounds and the presumed consequences for metabolic health Segments of the non scientific community and in particular the media avidly follow the developments of this research field The phenomenological ethno medical field has contributed observational and anecdotal results stimulating researchers to propose robust science based mechanisms of action In particular the definition of key molecular pathways affected by phytochemical and nutritional bioactive compounds is of crucial importance to understand health effects Unfortunately research in this area often lacked rigor reproducibility and molecular detail and its outcomes were therefore received with justifiable skepticism G N publishes original research papers and reviews dealing with bioactive constituents of traditional or novel foods and of botanical extracts targeted at promoting health and preventing or treating disease According to our scopes and aims G N encourages studies of the effects of bioactives on the modulation of biochemical pathways cellular signaling and gene expression In line with our quest for standardization studies dealing with the effects of natural compounds or food botanical extracts should report a complete characterization and standardization of the compound s under study to allow reproducibility Exceptions to this guideline may be possible with very strong evidence of the importance of their results or when dealing with novel botanical extracts of extreme interest whose effects have never been reported in the available literature and for which chemical characterization is in progress Nutritional bioinformatics As in other life science disciplines data science is an indispensable component of contemporary nutrition research With growing possibilities to measure store and analyze data and knowledge e g availability and means to effectively integrate and mine information is rapidly becoming a key determinant of successful translation of nutrition research into human health benefits e g Application of existing and development of new computational methods e g are being used for systems analysis of high dimensional multi omic data sets e g and their integration with physiological and clinical endpoints to infer health effects of interventions To promote leveraging advances in data science to facilitate goals of nutrition research G N has established a novel Nutritional Bioinformatics section Traditionally the disciplines of bioinformatics and nutrition research have evolved independently In this new section we emphasize the connection between the two recognizing the specific requirements for data science approaches in the context of nutrition research e g dealing with subtle and broad systems effects of dietary interventions as well as establishing state of art data handling practices within classical nutritional studies G N actively encourages efforts towards development and application of data analytics methods and resources tailored to use in nutrition research The Nutritional Bioinformatics section welcomes submission of articles addressing development and utilization of novel analytics approaches software tools and data resources relevant in the context of nutrition research Descriptions of newly developing research infrastructures aimed at providing services to the nutrition research community are also encouraged and welcomed Compliance of submissions with standards of good data practices such as FAIR guidelines data is required to be Findable Accessible Interoperable and Reusable is essential Summary Reproducibility or at least the ability to understand the reasons for different results and outcomes in preclinical and clinical research experiments is now demanding the attention of researchers funding agencies and the public e g The intent of this editorial was to provide guidance for improving the quality of systems nutrition research Table We recognize however that new developments will require constant updating of methods experimental designs and computational analysis As our climate changes and population growth increases to the expected nine billion by our field of research must continue to produce high quality reliable results that can be translated into health promoting action Genes Nutrition remains committed to promoting and publishing this research in a timely fashion to improve nutrition knowledge for applications for personal and public health Table Summary of genes and nutrition publication guidelines Standardization reproducibility of data and findings Manuscripts submitted to G N should contain the necessary information allowing evaluation of alignment with widely accepted best practices see Table for specific guidelines These standards include descriptions of reference materials and reagents study design laboratory protocols data analysis and reporting We recommend authors to refer to the MIBBI Portal Minimum Information for Biological and Biomedical Investigations for prescriptive checklists for reporting biological and biomedical research where applicable Gene variants G N manuscripts reporting associations between single SNPs and complex phenotypes or single SNPs and response to diet will not be sent for peer review unless i the effect size is large ii p values significant and corrected for multiple comparison and iii replicated in a second study Complex phenotypes include diseases anthropometric measures e g body weight or body mass index and intermediate risk factors e g levels or changes in fasting blood parameters Women s health research Sexual dimorphism in metabolic response should be assessed and when possible the phase of the menstrual cycle phase analyzed by one of the six methods described in Animal genetics G N will require strain designations and their commercial source for all studies Animal diets Different lots of chow diets vary in chemical composition with the best examples being

3902,3902,Some of the best CBD cream for arthritis pain biggest benefits that CBD is to be realized for is that it does certainly not induce as numerous adverse effects as weed This is actually definitely a perk for parents that are presently undertaking kid treatment with clinical weed Utilizing CBD suggests you can easily think unwinded and also your child may focus Yet another point that makes it a helpful is actually that there is actually little bit of or no health care documentation that youngsters may deal with possessing this in their unit As a matter of fact researches have actually presented that it might assist your youngster to sleep much better They may have much less gas discomforts and also in general there may be less hair loss One of the most integral part of taking this supplement is actually that you ought to never ever give it to a little one under the age of years old When your little one is years of ages it s up to you to determine if they manage to take this in their body There are some cases where there have been actually drug similar reactions and also it is actually absolute best that your little one certainly not take this supplement When you re calculating whether or even not you may include your little one in your therapy with health care weed is the grow older one essential factor to take into factor to consider It s secure enough for kids but it carries out depend upon the problem they possess If they have actually only begun adolescence there may be some issues if they are actually going to take the supplement Yet another trait to take note of is actually that Cannabidiol carries out possess positive impacts on youngsters It will definitely help them in numerous places of the body system It can be very helpful in lowering or even removing issues like abdominal pain nausea or vomiting spasticity throwing up impatience irregular bowel movements and also stress and anxiety Benefits that you are going to receive from this supplement are quite several Coming from the minute you start taking this it is actually achievable that you will definitely notice a remarkable decrease in your little one s symptoms You may also be able to lessen their addiction on medication Moms and dads ought to not take a chance along with their kids taking any sort of type of dangers that can easily cause all of them to experience adverse effects There are actually an amount of side effects that you should look at prior to you start this program of treatment The best important point to remember is actually that it s absolute best to stay away from utilizing this with children under the age of three years of ages One more trait to consider is that little ones are actually very prone to side effects The factor of the Cannabidiol is to maintain all of them from experiencing every one of the downsides that possess marijuana If you should continue to utilize this then it is actually finest to utilize it along with adult direction The adverse effects related to using this are moderate A child that is three years old ought to certainly not be taken through mouth This is actually done to guarantee they do not develop any concerns Several of the side effects related to CBD consist of diarrhea fatigue as well as unsteadiness It is most ideal to consult with your doctor regarding any type of potential adverse effects before your youngster starts utilizing this Remember that this is actually all dependent on just how serious your youngster s state is actually Kids are going to additionally experience a couple of adverse effects if you are actually alleviating all of them with this They may experience swelling irritation tickling and or rash This ought to certainly not lead to any kind of bodily pain for your little one At times your child may still be actually very vulnerable If you experience any type of negative effects that you are not sure of then you should immediately discontinue any sort of usage Using this product will not trigger your youngster to suffer The FDA has actually just recently accepted a Cannabidiol CBD pill to alleviate grownups with non intractable epilepsy This supplement is actually taken into consideration an advance for those struggling with this devastating health problem It has actually taken a while for health care researchers to understand the organic results of cannabinoids in the human body Recently these representatives were just recognized as being a highly effective approach of managing nausea as well as throwing up But these brokers are actually even more intricate than that Regrettably researches on cannabidiol have actually been actually prevented by the truth that research studies need to become finished using lab computer mice which perform not really mimic the true human condition Many of the synthetic cannabinoid materials in usage at the time performed certainly not create a lot benefit In short if it had not been for lab study many people would still be actually suffering from seizures that were actually totally irrepressible A number of the signs and symptoms linked with the various convulsion disorders are vertigo memory loss dry oral cavity trouble strolling convulsions struggled breathing and abdominal cramping If our team can determine the sources of these problems then our company may create techniques that will definitely assist our team to control all of them While our company re on the target of seizure ailments I m visiting point out hemp oil extraction which is most likely among the most effective kinds of confiscation drugs It holds true that CBD supplements may not be an alternative currently There are other confiscation medicines that may be feasible possibilities for treatment While CBD could be very successful it won t operate unless the individual experiencing the confiscation possesses a specific demand Or else it is absolutely ineffective A person along with confiscation conditions can certainly not constantly figure out the root cause of their seizures Insome instances the reason is actually unknown and also they require to check out numerous options to help them handle the circumstance Using CBD implies you may feel relaxed and also your kid may center Another thing to take in to factor is that Cannabidiol does possess positive effects on children Parents need to not take an odds with their children taking any sort of kind of risks that can trigger all of them to go through coming from side impacts The very most crucial point to keep in mind is actually that it s best to steer clear of utilizing this along with youngsters under the grow older of three years old It is most effectively to speak to along with your doctor concerning any possible

2468,2468,"The SNP Red Dot lifting mask - firming is a unique mask that comes with four red dot patches and also has ear loops. The main ingredients of this mask are Betaine, glutathione and pearl extract. It also contains hydrolysed collagen for lifting and firming. It is a multifunctional mask and it's effects include acupressure, massage, nutrition and lifting. The acupressure effect triggered by the dot gives simple and inexpensive blood circulation. This mask also provides immediate relief for fatigued and weak skin by forming a moisture barrier. I used this mask at night after cleansing and toning my face, I applied the red dot patches under my eyes and at the corners of my mouth, and then wore the mask over them. I was able to use the ear loops over my ears, this ensured that my chins were completely covered up to my neck, but it also made the mask very uncomfortable around my eyes. I left the mask on for twenty minutes and then took it off, I noticed a brighter and more plump skin. I like the idea of a full coverage mask but the eye opening should be made slightly larger. I received this mask from 0.8l and SNP for a trial fee in exchange for my honest review."

ducks and Undertaker s arm goes through the window of the hearse His arm is bleeding and he cooly says Son of a bitch Undertaker slams him on the windshield and puts him on top of the hearse They fight it out on top of the hearse Undertaker takes him down and punches away at him Styles falls onto the grass Undertaker gets down and says he has a lot more to give Styles quickly throws dirt in his face and low blows him Styles picks him up and brings him to the grave he dug for him Undertaker punches him down and knocks him into the plot hole Gallows and Anderson show up and say they re

Michelle never should have let him out Styles punches away at Undertaker and breaks his hand on his skull in the process Styles tells Undertaker to stay down but he pulls himself up Styles then tackles him through a fence Styles gets up and sad music is playing Styles peppers Undertaker with punches and says he thought he was the American Badass Now he looks like a broken down old bitch

the spine with it to knock him into the plot Styles lifts up dirt and says Ashes to ashes dust to dust Undertaker is shown lying in the hole Styles gets on a tractor to pour dirt on him but all of a

3504,3504,LFG Age location occupation I am from the Lower Blue Mountains so about an hour and a half west of Sydney studying law at Sydney University while I am part time at two law firms with different levels of responsibility at each one one s unpaid and incredibly fulfilling challenging and the like the other is paid but is not really an area I am interested in Tell us in ten words or less why no one should ever put their photo on their CV unless they re going for a role on screen or in modelling Particularly one which has someone else s disembodied arm in the pic Evidence Act NSW s89 a You sometimes go for quite a while without posting then when you come back you re prolific on CC then move onto OT Politics or Site Discussion without seeming to break stride I ve read a number of your posts and noticed a lot of dichotomy in your posts and posting styles I guess what I m asking is Will the real Shady Slim please stand up Yeah you have got some pretty valid points here I am busy a lot of the time and lurk a lot liking a lot of posts then go on big posting binges when I have time to do so if I had more of a consistent schedule I d probably get in to a rhythm with it and post sensibly but as it is what happens is I wind up with a lot of takes I do not get to post until I get time and then they all come out at once when I do find the time to get on and get posting Something else that is probably a factor is I spend frick all time editing my posts backspacing thinking about what I said instead it s very stream of consciousness halfbaked unpolished sort of straight from the tap and in to your lap incoherence my posting would be a lot less ass if I just spent some time thinking about what I am saying so it s more congruent tbh What s your earliest cricketing memory How long have you played for the one club My dad put me in to cricket in I think it was but back then I wasn t sporty the way I am now I was just sort of a guy And when I am not all that passionate about something I really find it hard to get up for it and we have all been there so I was very very bad back then but probably the earliest memory was a degree day when I stayed out there for longer than anyone else made but just did not get out exact opposite of how I play now where if I had anything that resembled patience I d be aces though I am just too irresponsible with the stick Got back in to playing back at the same club with a passion for it to train and to play and much more success So technically you could say I have played there since or maybe it was probably but really you d have to say since You re pretty left wing as most intelligent people are What s informed that viewpoint and how good is it that the frothing and ravings of the likes of Corrin and Cribb reinforce one s hatred for all things libertarian Politics is a very important thing to me as you know so get ready for a longer one My mum has always had strong labor party values and imbued those in me from a young age but as I got older in to that age bracket where every teenage white boy s dream is to say the n word even though I still was a labor man economically I went through a real edgy phase in terms of social politics to make this worse being I did not have much of a bullshit detector and so I was much more likely to always buy any vapid disgusting take that was parroted by the media or by a family member soon after I had joined here I would have either been or I repeated a very ill informed take I had heard from a family member or maybe Mark Latham about Indigenous Australians and entitlements and copped a right dressing down from Top Cat as I deserved for it I d say that a lot of this way of thinking came from the fact that until about ish I wasn t much of a sportsman and hung around video game discussion boards quagmires of the worst political opinions there are Thank that I got in to fitness and being cool otherwise there s a nonzero chance I d be one of those edgy economically left sexist racists who thinks it s funny to make fun of minorities still I have digressed a bit but something else that contributed to me nearly going down that road was disillusionment with mainstream politics Labor here did not have much in the way of charismatic leadership and I just did not feel like there was anything in politics that spoke to me being young I did not realise that saying certain words was bad and had impacts that jokes are not jokes to some people because they are reflective of institutional oppression they have faced all their lives and so on but then come Shorten s campaign was a damn good one and despite what Alan Jones says he came in with more charisma and more clarity than he ever had before in that campaign I followed along the US elections from the primaries as well first as a lol look at trump lol but I was just so struck by Bernie his message and what he fought for and that s what saved me from the path of economic lefty who complains the LGBTQIA+ acronym is getting to long and set me on the path of guy who has excellent progressive social and economic politics It s a lot of fun to joke about libertarians but I came damn well close to going down that dark path myself and with the greatest of respects to GIMH and PEWS sike lol with none at all I am very very glad I did not take that path looking back at the old me as the now me Who s the best looking most intelligent CW member you ve met In answering keep in mind that I can withdraw your CV from circulation to the Sydney legal profession at any time Sure this is where I say given you are the only one I have met it s you but you have pushed your luck here old man because you are the only CWer I have met you are also the least good looking and least intelligent What s your happiest childhood memory Oh jeez this is a hard one I d probably have to say going to NZ with mum in when I was it s still the only time I have been overseas and we just had a super memorable time I have still got a shirt does not fit now but it s got a black sheep surrounded by all these white sheep and it says where in the flock am I which is the epitome of comedy tbh We had so much fun there and met so many cool people on the tour group we saw a sheep show and we almost were dragged in to two friends we made there breaking in to a church it was just crazy cool Even going there on the flight was just so much fun You live in the Lower Blue Mountains How many flannos do you own and what colour is your favourite What are the benefits and drawbacks to living where you do Believe it or not none But once I was at my dad s in Burpengary QLD split parents I probably would have been twelve or about that and he got me this flanno that was way oversized and it was your typical red and white and black flanno His dog had just had pups at the time so what I did heaps was wear the super baggy flanno and let all the pups jump up on me and play around in the flanno while I had it on it was the cutest thing In terms of the mountains what s great is it s a place where people say hi and good morning when you walk past on the street there is that real sense of community and of togetherness here and that is really cool to live in I went to Penrith High and spent a lot of time there still do and if you smile at someone in the street they give you the biggest dirty and then they stab you No in between So that is to me a cool part of living here something small nice though that and the natural beauty which speaks for itself tbh The drawback is that being far from the city and having that small town vibes there s not enough of the ambition and the drive for me to be where I want here most people here are happy where they are content not fussed by being just your average guy and great for them No doubt with a simpler and kinder worldview I would probably not be a giant cynical ass like I am but for me on account of how ambitious and driven I am it s just not a place I can see myself living my adult life What other sports apart from cricket do you play If you can call them playing cross country and taekwondo I am also very handy with an American football If you had the opportunity to use any CWer as a crash test dummy for martial arts training would you choose zorax or sunilz Explain your choice Tbh both of them are thick as cement so you d shatter your foot trying to kick them but given that if I kicked zorax I would not have any one to like my posts anymore I have gotta go with sunilz You have in the past described yourself as extroverted and charismatic How do you reconcile this with your online persona which is an utter dirge Legit while a lot of people are introverted and come to places like forums to express themself and feel more comfortable behind a screen I am someone who more than most relies a lot on vibe and gesture and the feel I get when I read people to talk and engage and get my point across so unironically I do find it a bit harder to communicate online than in person which idk you probably do not see much plus also that thing about me not editing my posts lol What do you foresee as the changes likely to be brought about to Australian society as a result of the pandemic How do they compare with what you would like to see change Honestly I do not see all that much changing unfortunately except for the worse Maybe you will get more people being mindful of personal hygiene on that micro level but societally all we are gonna see in the near future is so much more racism So much more Maybe we will get a big push to buy Australian owned and I am more than some some chud like Clive Palmer will clamber to be the face of it but unless we rid the scab that is Scomo from parliament how good is a pandemic then I am not all too sure we will get good change I am sure that Morrison and Dutton will engage very gladly in China bashing of the subtle variety when this is said and done What I would like to be done is for us to wake up and realise we should always be stockpiled and ready for these things and would also like to see that micro level push of people being hygienic it s ridiculous it s taken a global pandemic for people to wash their hands lol But to me the big thing is that it s shocked me how underprepared we are at a federal level to help people with supplies in a time of crisis we should have more ironclad plans in place for these things and I hope that we learn What s your favourite travel location Why I have not done much travelling as I said above though NZ is there for those childhood memories we went to the north island only but jeez the Bay of Island was such a beautiful place Port Kembla of all the places is where I went with Mrs S and we had our one year and that was really special too we went there December and it was the first adult holiday that I have been on so that was cool too and for all of the memories we made there as well When and why did you learn Italian Has it proven useful apart from ordering a parmi Always had it around me as a family thing did it to year ten in high school and then went back to it mid last year to learn it fully properly but at the core it s the family connection that drew me Outside of just in the family sphere the most recent time I used it was watching JoJo s Bizarre Adventure which is a Japanese show but they are in Italy and it was cool to be able to read stuff Looks great on a resume As someone who has both played and loved cricket for so long how did you react when you discovered Sunil Gavaskar is an appalling racist who thinks West Indian supporters should go back to the trees where they belong Sunil Gavaskar A racist Well I could would should never believe such a thing I think you should tell me the forum more about this so we can better form our opinions tbh You seem to be someone who prefers the humanities over maths and science Congratulations on not falling for the maths affliction which so plagues many CWers and by extension this place What drew you to your chosen career path and if you could have an alternative career what would it be This starts off very stupid but gets better I promise When I was little about ten I played a lot of this game Disney s Toontown Online You are a Toon which is a bipedal animal thing think Goofy or Mickey and you have to save your world from the Cogs who are these evil corporate robots who want to suck the Disney fun out of the world with their eh corporate ness One of them was the Law Bots and they were the evil cog lawyers I thought all of their legalese lawyer puns and phrases the Law Bot characters had were so so cool And so from then I wanted to do law But then as I got older and learned more about the world growing up the way I did below the poverty line and learning of the spectre of institutional socioeconomic disadvantage how there are millions of people in Australia who for a plethora of reasons outside of their control struggle to put food on the table just like we did and how this is not right how this is not fair but how it s so cyclical and so perpetuated my dream sort of refined into wanting to practice an area of law where I can help the disadvantaged and the powerless such as employment law From there it went to realising the best way to get change is to be the change and got me to where I am now the naive and idealistic dream of federal politics after a career fighting for the little guy in the courtroom If it wasn t that barring serving on the judicial bench which is my backup it d have to be physio the domain of every successful high school athlete like me who was an ace in school but not good enough for nationals and has half a brain in their head What s the number one place on your bucket list Why I am huge in to American sports so I would love to do a Super Bowl and Stanley Cup final along with a Steelers and Penguins home game s sake of all the places it s Pittsburgh If I can I would very very very very much like to see Evgeni Malkin who is my favourite Penguin skate in a game before he retires Who was your childhood cricket hero Why Warnie He has got that mystique that makes you want to follow what he does and he s why I bowl legspin though I do it as a part time thing do not turn it and come with a vertical arm so not the way he did it at all lol growing up I also was a huge Chaminda Vaas fan because as a five year olds I loved all of the Sri Lankan players and their cool names but in my house being a Murali fan was a no go on account of my dad s strict anti Murali stance and so the next one up for me was Vaas What s your ideal date night Gonna be such a nark here and say every night with Mrs S is special in its own ideal way but really it s more the elements good food fun conversation time together we have spent a lot of time in the city just hanging out under the stars getting ourselves a nice meal and setting up a blanket in a park gazing up at the moon and the stars and to me that s just sublime Why the Costanza avatar I am quite the Seinfeld man and even though George is not at all my role model he s far too neurotic and has far too little hair this one is from a scene in The Abstinence where he s in the nets at Yankee Stadium and hits a huge dinger out of the park in front of a Yankees batter because of his newfound mental abilities that he s gained from being abstinent and there s just something about being completely out of your depth but oh so smug while you are there that resonates with me Lastly assume you re going to be stuck on a desert island for a year Choose one of each of the following to take a Book b Album c CW member apart from me obvs d Movie e TV show boxed set f Game g Sporting equipment sufficient to become proficient at which sport Here we are now at the final stretch you all are almost done Congratulations if you have read every q you have done well to wade through all my ramblings and I do have that tendency to digress and to ramble lol For book I would have said a photo album of memories of home but that might be too depressing after a while so I will go with Moneyball Album you d have to give me RHCP s greatest hits If we can not do a greatest hits then Californication but I will say that Electric Ladyland by JHE and Savage Garden s selftitled albums are a close second It has got to be Gnske he will think of a new bit every now and then to keep things interesting and I will not ban the guy for it smh Seinfeld it s got to be Given that it s a desert island I will say Team Fortress because it s not a story game it is a multiplayer vs shooter so you can not finish it American football I already said that I am handy with a handegg and I am damn good though there s a difference between being the best in the Blue Mountains at gridion and being good enough to take on the pros cheers for the q s burge they all had me thinking sorry everyone for the ramble as i said i have a tendency to get sidetracked and to ramble if any of you made it through all of it congratulations i hope ya enjoyed the read hehe

8089,8089,hours ago The last time I ordered a chai latte it came out all wrong I asked for almond milk instead of regular I am lactose intolerant and I requested the barista use just a touch of honey rather than the normal amount of sugar processed sweets spike my anxiety When they called my name at the counter I grabbed my drink said a quick thank you and took a sip as I was walking out the door As soon as I tasted it I could tell it had been butchered accidentally I am sure but butchered all the same I had just coughed up the last of my cash for this beverage so there was no way I was about to toss it out I turned on my heels and walked back to the two guys behind the counter Sorry but I started off They raised their eyebrows at me and smiled Hey sorry I said again It s just that I asked for almond milk and honey in this and I think there s been a mistake The line was starting to back up behind me making me feel slightly guilty but they kindly took my drink anyway and started all over again I suddenly felt sheepish about my double feature of apologies I had done nothing wrong except agree to pay five whole dollars for a tea When they handed me my revised chai I thanked them once again and went on my way This is a common occurrence for me I apologize on the regular for an assortment of minute things ordering a dish without meat requesting paperwork from a coworker asking my partner to pick up something for me on the way home It seems silly to make these apologies since I do not feel regret or penitence which is a definition of sorry I do not even know why I keep expressing regret It s just become a habit So I decided to enter a little differently I made it one of my New Year s resolutions to stop saying sorry unless of course I did something heinous in an attempt to be more confident in my words and actions This seemed like an especially relevant resolution considering the fact that women apologize more often than men according to a study published in the journal Psychological Science in The study required individuals between the ages and to keep a diary for days They documented when they said sorry why they did and how often they felt like someone had been offended by their actions Both men and women equally apologized about percent of the time they felt like they wronged someone The difference however lied in how often men and women felt like there was actually something to take offense to Women apparently have a lower threshold for what they think requires reparation while men are more likely to let a lot of things slide Karina Schumann one of the study s researchers and a doctoral student in social psychology at the University of Waterloo explains to Live Science Women might have a lower threshold for what requires an apology because they are more concerned with the emotional experiences of others and in promoting harmony in their relationships In other words when it comes to apologizing when they are sorry for something women and men apologize at the same rate It s just that women feel like they have a lot more things to be sorry for so they say sorry far more often Embed It got me thinking about how my partner approaches a barista or a server when his order is not right Excuse me mate he always starts off he s Australian He never leads with a sorry I also could not remember a single time he apologized for correcting someone when they misspelled his name for instance I on the other hand tossed out unwarranted apologies left and right like candy corn on Halloween night Most of the time my sorry was nothing more than a filler word like so or um But I could not deny the fact that there were plenty of times in everyday life especially in work related situations when I said sorry simply because I did not want to come off as demanding I recalled the last time I was stuck on the couch feeling sick and my friend kindly offered to bring me a few things from the grocery store When I called to request that she also pick up a bottle of vitamin C I predictably kicked off the question with Hey so sorry but could you also I was grateful that she was doing me this tremendous favor but I did not want to push the limit and ask too much of her Similarly anytime I have to remind someone at work to complete a task they promised to do it s always prefaced with a soft apology The last thing I want is for someone to take me the wrong way or quite frankly think of me as a nag I could see that my standard sorry represented an internal discomfort I have with speaking up in certain settings I want to shed this habit in because not allowing myself to apologize will mean I will also have to find a way to be more self assured and aware of my language Plus refraining from apologizing will encourage me to just ask for what I want without all the fluff Embed When I was young I remember being asked by adults which doll was my favorite while the boys around me were being asked what they wanted to be when they grew up I wasn t exactly taught to be assertive and society has encouraged us to view strong outspoken women as bitches On the other hand men have been given the opportunity to do anything and everything without apology for centuries even if it was at the expense of women And in today s political climate especially I am sick of that bullsh t I know nixing the word sorry from my vocabulary will not solve all of my upcoming problems in But it s certainly a useful step to take if I want to become more comfortable using my voice without fear of sounding pushy Besides so what if I come on a little strong There s absolutely nothing wrong with knowing what kind of tea you want and how you want it As for now you will have to stay tuned for my progress to see how my resolution goes Check out the You IRL stream in the Bustle App for updates on Gina s progress and daily tips on how to have an empowering Images Giphy Gina Florio

2177,2177,"I'm not a doctor but I would say getting her back to the vet is the most important thing right now. If you are waiting for an appointment with your regular vet get Cleo to an ER vet clinic. Just FYI, purring does not necessarily mean they are ok, cats also purr when stressed. I had a similar situation with one of my cats, GB, just a few weeks ago, matching most of the symptoms you listed. I noticed that he had thrown up his meal, and while not hiding, staying away from the family. GB is a 7 year old tabby that sleeps with me in my bed and the next day he would not get out of the bed. I knew something was wrong because breakfast is his favorite meal. He wouldn't eat, wouldn't drink and seemed lethargic. My regular vet was booked and unable to see him. so I took him to an ER vet clinic. They asked to keep him for observation. The next day I was told he had developed a fever overnight that spiked to just over 105. They treated him with anti-viral meds and IVs to keep him hydrated. He is now recovered and back to his old self. The ER clinic said it was a good thing I brought him in when I did because a combination of fever and dehydration can very quickly lead to organ failure. You didn't mention a fever on the first visit but then mine didn't develop a fever until that night at the ER."

3220,3220,Margherita Missoni had no chance in hell of being a minimalist The granddaughter of Tai and Rosita who founded the brand as a small Italian knitwear workshop back in and daughter of current creative director Angela who solidified Missoni as the global fashion house we know today Margherita tried to steer herself away but kept finding herself return to the cacophony of colours the plethora of patchworks and of course those zigzags Four years ago Margherita left the family business to pursue her own career path I found it hard decisions are made more emotionally than rationally when working with family but she was fighting against her DNA She grew up in the very heart of the Missoni legacy We all lived pretty close to each other and I was surrounded by my grandparents work as well as the people who worked in the factory and atelier It was the school of life for me being exposed to people from different backgrounds with such different styles But when I was working on my own I had to stop myself from going too Missoni because that s my tendency we all share the same aesthetic and style The difference is each one of us brings with us the time we are living in our own zeitgeist And that s exactly what she s done with her first collection for M Missoni Previously a brand license the newly revived lower priced M line is Missoni for a younger generation a remixed refreshed revived Missoni for Margherita s zeitgeist M is about making clothes for real people she tells me backstage ahead of her first collection presentation having been appointed creative director last October If Missoni stands for fashion in the traditional sense and is uncompromising in its aesthetic then M is saturated with the needs of the people who wear them the free spirited the irreverent the playful With M I have flipped the well known hit record and started to play the B side So how does one create something recognisably Missoni while ensuring a fresh perspective Go back to the very beginning Missoni was created with the objective of making an outfit that would take you effortlessly and elegantly from morning to evening Margherita explains That s why they chose to specialise in knitwear and jerseys But over the years that concept was lost because the brand s communication moved towards the luxury end of high fashion I thought the origin of our brand would resonate with an audience today The M mission is to remix re use and respect its mother brand and Margherita is doing this by mining the house s archives for yarns fabrics and logos and spinning them into something new This plays out in a collection that is unmistakably Missoni but for a new generation Heritage Missoni Sport a trademark back in the s that would not look out of place on a Hypebeast in pieces are reworked into windbreakers oversized jersey hoodies and tracksuit trousers via embroidery and tie dye space dye one of the brand s most celebrated knit effects is cut up and embedded into new knitwear making each piece s yarn unique vintage perfume logos are reworked as prints and Missoni Home furnishing fabrics now make up coats and jackets The fact that everything in the collection is taken from something from the archives the print that never made it the yarns that were never used makes the M brand feel even more contemporary in an over saturated and environmentally damaging industry recycling is finally losing its unfashionable image and becoming a smart and cool part of a business in Does Margherita consider her label sustainable I do not want to claim it is I do not feel confident in that yet even though we have great sustainability initiatives This is about recycling and appropriating ideas It s about sharing a side of the brand that is not well known and communicating that to a younger audience so they are aware of the brand s history We are introduced to Margherita s idea of this audience on day two of Milan Fashion Week Having been appointed creative director nearly one year ago she s had plenty of time to plan the perfect debut presentation I saw an old campaign photo of models in Missoni on a tram and the tram really symbolises Milan so I ran with the concept Editors having taken shelter from the Milanese sunshine with crisp lemonade wedges of parmesan and fresh bread are treated to performances by energetic dancers with faces painted with old Missoni chevron stripes A bright pink tram pulls up to the venue and we alight alongside a gaggle of diverse models wearing the collection We take a tour of the city and at each stop the models get off the tram as a new cohort hops on Everyone is street cast and almost everyone is from Milan with the exception of a few friends who work in fashion Tagwalk s Alexandra Van Houtte and DJ Sita Abellan are amongst them Margherita says There are women in their s in gold bralets and flared knitted trousers men in crop tops and skirts and Gen Zers in sweater vests layered over workwear shirts Many are just people I knew I wanted to dress but M is for everyone and what unites them all is their approach to life a lightness a playfulness irony all qualities that you must possess in order to feel good in this world As Margherita s gang of models dance and strut and party on the fuschia tram to an eclectic soundtrack of Floyd Cramer Andrew Bird and The Soup Dragons that playfulness is palpable and along with that inherited knack for colour perhaps just the antidote to all the darkness in the world right now Like what you see How about some more R29 goodness right

10996,10996,One in four adults in America are living with a disability but you would not know it with the lack of representation in media Hollywood and the workforce We are shedding light on the real stories not the caricatures of this dynamic and vibrant community of individuals Read more stories from our Voices of Disability series In my freshman year of college I made a plan to get coffee with a former English teacher whom I will call Mark during my fall break This first name basis that students had with their teachers was a linchpin of the progressive private high school I attended Whether it was because of this institutionalized egalitarianism or his personable warm energy Mark always seemed like less of an authority figure to me and more like an uncle Most mornings Mark and I would run into each other on the train as we both made the exodus from the Upper West Side to Gramercy In these minutes first thing in the morning we talked about his family and mine the books we liked and the best bagel in Manhattan I remember feeling a rush of excitement when Mark would share mundane details about his life with me it made me feel like we were truly friends I hoped that he had thought of me as a precocious year old but in my heart of hearts I knew he probably thought I was just a lonely nerd who liked to read Yet now with what felt like an immeasurable amount of time and distance from high school i e four months I wanted to impress him and prove that I was thriving I d regale him with my own critical perspective on Hegel and my love for As I Lay Dying and I d show him how I was a well liked certified cool kid with friends I had even gotten into doing stand up comedy I met Mark outside of the school lobby feeling relieved that I would not have to step through those doors again Mark greeted me and gave me a slightly awkward side hug We walked to Everyman Espresso a proletariat title for a coffee shop that charges for a latte While he was in the bathroom I ordered myself an iced coffee I made sure to pay for myself I did not want there to be any awkwardness So what have you been up to What s new Mark asked when he returned Well actually I have started doing stand up comedy I said expecting to elicit some awe and admiration Oh wow are you talking about your hand I felt my body tense This topic had always seemed off limits Indeed one of the most distinctive features about myself is something I avoided discussing at all costs in my comedy routine I was born without a left hand a condition that makes it hard to type climb or chop a clove of garlic As a child this was merely a source of frustration It prevented me from swinging from the monkey bars or twisting my hair into a high ponytail But in my teenage years my hand became a source of deep insecurity I hid behind cavernous sweatshirts my armor against the world When college started I began wearing a prosthesis which drastically changed my sense of self I felt wildly more confident with it as though I was able to be the person I never felt I could be I wore sleeveless shirts I took up space and most significantly I tried to forget who I was before Well actually I pulled up my sleeve gradually to show Mark the prosthesis I was wearing Oh wow that s I mean that s great he said his eyes widening Yeah uh I I know it really is I feel a lot better about myself now I guess Well I am happy for you I remember how you used to hide it your hand I mean In my teenage years my hand became a source of deep insecurity I hid behind cavernous sweatshirts my armor against the world There was only a slight lapse in the conversation but it felt like an eternity I remember how you used to hide it kept ringing in my head Here was the one person who I felt respected me but maybe he saw me in the way I feared everyone else did A weird kid who was profoundly self conscious I forgot about Hegel and Faulkner about all of my new friends and all of the new things I had pushed myself to do I felt a lump form in my throat Yeah I guess I did But like I said I feel a lot better about myself now Even if you are wearing a prosthesis I still think you should be talking about it That s good comedy putting words to all that And you are not one to shy away from a challenge I smiled lightly Mark was speaking to me with such candor yet this honesty was not the kind I craved I felt exposed and belittled I needed to cut this conversation short while I still had some dignity left So tell me about how the year is going Any changes to the curriculum I mustered And just like that we got on a different track We did not return to the topic of my stand up comedy for the rest of our time together and I could not shake how I felt for days It seemed like I had no way to win When I did expose my underdeveloped left hand the stares of others felt like a searing sting Yet even with my prosthesis the comfort I felt in my own skin seemed fragile as if the sense of self I d constructed could fall and shatter at any moment In my freshman year my new friends soon found out that my left hand seemingly so life like was in fact a pale silicone imitation The first time this happened I felt a pit grow heavy in my stomach My secret had been found out It was a Saturday night in September The air was sticky with that cloying end of summer heat There were a gaggle of us all dancing with the lights off in someone s cramped dorm room My new friend Katie blue eyed and American Girl doll like grabbed my hand to twirl me around and quickly realized something was off I met her shocked expression and sputtered out an explanation growing as red as the boxed wine we d been drinking The charade was up I worried that Katie saw me as I saw myself ugly As college went on I grew more comfortable with people knowing about my disability Yet even so the idea that my deepest insecurity could become common knowledge terrifies me Last year The Hysterics the stand up comedy group I performed with throughout my time in college began planning a benefit show to raise money for the last private abortion clinic in Connecticut We wanted to draw a big audience and so we booked Crowell Concert hall a venue that can accommodate over people I had to cobble together a set but I was tired of all my jokes about how my preferred party activity is monitoring the pile of coats on a bed or the time some boy accidentally booty called my father instead of me I liked to think these tales are unique to my experiences but in truth they could be told by anyone When I first began performing standup felt like a mode of escapism When the lights went up I stepped into my onstage persona With a mic in hand I was in control of the narrative Yet over time this habit of deliberately divulging only certain aspects of my life did not feel liberating Instead it had started to feel like a self imposed restraint of what I could and could not say I was frustrated with my instinct to retreat in fear of what people might think Over time this habit of deliberately divulging only certain aspects of my life did not feel liberating A couple of days before the show my friend Cam and I were talking out our potential sets Cam can do knockout impressions construct hilariously deft stories and have the audience wrapped around her finger with a single line I laid on Cam s bed with my feet against the wall as we tossed around various ideas As we talked I picked at the skin around my nails a habit that had only gotten worse with age Across the room Cam swiveled in her desk chair and threw a pink stress ball between her hands Each time she palmed the ball in her left she gave it a firm squeeze Ok ok what do you think of this All I am saying is The Pixar film Ratatouille set my expectations for the vegetable based dish ratatouille unreasonably high Cam said looking at me expectantly Ha I like that I responded continuing to pull at my skin Cool I think I am gonna do the bit about how I lick peanut butter off the spoon like a dog and also the Sex and the City one What are you gonna do Cam asked My finger started to bleed Uh one of the things I have been thinking about telling is the story of how before I left for college my mom s way of coping was taking pictures of me sleeping Oh yeah that s so weird Cam said giving a half hearted laugh You can definitely do that I mean I was also thinking about how I could tell this one story that happened last spring And so I began to tell Cam a wild story about someone who sought to empathize with me over my hand but had completely and hilariously missed the mark Even with Cam a person who had been my friend for most of college this story felt deeply vulnerable My hand was the focus of the narrative Without even looking I could feel her staring at my prosthesis as we talked But at the end Cam burst into laughter You have to do that bit in your set she exclaimed In truth I had been holding onto stories like these for ages I knew they went deeper than my other one liners and bizarre anecdotes I was still terrified but I wanted to tell the things that were honest that rang true For so long I had been drawn to stories that could be told by anyone Now I felt the stories that I d buried start to stir As the event drew closer my anxiety worsened My head was full of everything that could go wrong What if I forgot a critical joke or what if there was a chorus of pity laughs Even worse what if the entirety of the act was met with deafening silence I asked myself why I was so bent on doing this Was a part of me trying to please Mark Had this idea stuck with me merely because it had first been planted in my head by an authority figure who seemed to get me Or was this something I truly wanted to do Liv Ryan performs standup comedy with The Hysterics a comedy troupe in Connecticut On the evening of the show all of The Hysterics gathered in the green room of the concert hall My friend Emma had brought a case of Mike s Hard Lemonade for everyone and we waited for the seats to fill Time seemed to move unbelievably slowly In the minutes before the set I felt the tick of the clock reverberate through each notch of my spine Suddenly the MC was introducing me and I walked on to the stage The lights were glaring and I felt myself begin to sweat under their heat The audience was a swath of classmates I knew and did not know I could make direct eye contact with the girl I shared an ex with a fairly new friend and a secret crush I gulped and began So I was born without a left hand and I wear a prosthesis That was it The hardest line And it was over just like that I had peeled off the Band Aid to reveal the cut I had closed over I let out the next line It s not something I am ashamed of but at the same time it s not something that I love to broadcast Like I am not walking into a room of new people being like Fake hand Who wants to touch eh I was doing it and people were laughing I leaned in I felt reassured in the fact that there was nothing I could do now The hardest part was over and now I could let the words fall from my mouth I had built up this moment in my mind for ages and now it was over Almost always when people find out I have a fake hand they brush past it because either they feel awkward or they do not want to make me feel uncomfortable But this is not always the case One time I was drunkenly peeing in the bathroom with someone I had just met and she starts looking at my arm and is like Dude what s going on with your hand right now And I am like Oh it s fake it s a prosthetic limb and she gets so apologetic and starts going on like I am so sorry I really do feel like I should say something vulnerable about myself to make you feel better And I am like You really do not need to I am fine But she insists and says One time in the third grade I shat myself and I had to go home to change my pants I am looking at her and I am thinking I hate to break it to you my friend but that is not the same The crowd burst into laughter I kept going There was this time I was playing cards with my friend Thomas and it s hard for me to hold cards So I am trying to prop them up on my thigh and they are all spilling on the ground And Thomas goes Do you not know how to hold cards and I was like Actually no I do not I explained to him why and he was like Oh my god fuck I am so sorry Look I do not want this to sound insensitive but do you know Buster from Arrested Development Then I said Um excuse me Do I know Buster The fictional character from a television show who gets his hand eaten off by a seal and wears a hook for a hand in the remaining seasons Yes I do But that is purely coincidence I had built up this moment in my mind for ages and now it was over The lights went down There was a chorus of applause especially from the corner where my friends sat I felt a sense of relief and a rush of accomplishment For so long the thought of making this aspect of my body so publicly legible seemed like an impossible feat But now at the top of the summit my prior fears and anxieties seemed small and inconsequential Years ago I had thought that talking about my hand in stand up would be disastrous In my elaborate nightmarish fantasies I imagined my peers would scream in horror perhaps even gouge their eyes out when I revealed my true self I shuddered to think that strangers would recoil at my touch Perhaps I d walk into the cafeteria to find everyone pointing at me and laughing However my delusional brain seemed to be giving me too much credit In the weeks after the show my life resumed as normal Those who did not already know about my difference did not seem to mind or even think twice The one who cared the most deeply had been me And so this set had not been about Mark even though he had acted as the catalyst It had not been for or about anyone else but me I had done this for the version of myself who as a kid had blinked three times fast in front of a bathroom mirror and hoped magic would change her This was for the person who had been so utterly terrified of her body being exposed to the world that she hid perpetually under pilled sweaters I had done this to to prove to myself that I could lean into the things that scared me I had done this to prove that my own body wasn t something to fear For so long I believed that sharing the truth about my disability would reduce me to a synecdoche that I d always be the girl with the hand But after I had brought my whole unadulterated self into the light I realized others saw me in a way I did not always see myself And now that I have opened up this box I see a trove of potential material Just a couple of weeks ago I had an experience related to my hand and my immediate thought was I have to put this in my standup Edited by Kelly Dawson a disability advocate who was born with cerebral palsy and has a master s degree in media communications Like what you see How about some

7647,7647,Tummy Tuck Terror A patient came for a consult with me after having a tummy tuck by an unqualified surgeon which left her with misplaced scars that ruined the appearance of her abdomen When I reviewed her before and after photos I realized that a pre existing tattoo near her belly button had not moved at all after her surgery indicating that her abdominal skin was never actually tightened Thankfully this was a repairable situation but I had to explain that she had sadly undergone a sham surgery which had done nothing except create unwanted scars Robert Cohen plastic surgeon Filler That Makes Skin Look Blue At least once a month someone comes to see me to correct filler under their eyes injected by another doctor that has turned their skin blue It s usually because the product is being injected too superficially or the wrong filler is used If hyaluronic acid fillers were originally used they can usually be reversed with hyaluronidase which acts like an antidote Rebecca Baxt dermatologist A Puffy Pucker Many patients I see are overfilled or have filler placed in the wrong area Luckily most of these patients had injections with hyaluronic acid fillers In particular one patient had filler in her lips by another dermatologist for lip augmentation She developed multiple lumps and her lips were asymmetrical Fortunately this was easily corrected with hyaluronidase a product that melts fillers and another procedure was performed to restore her lips Gary Goldenberg dermatologist Irritated by Ingredients I have many patients come to me for help with sudden allergies and sensitivities to products Product companies are not required to notify consumers if they have added ingredients or changed formulations If a reaction to an ingredient is going to develop it takes time initially to become sensitized and upon each subsequent exposure that time is decreased It is advised to use patch testing to check for allergic reactions If an allergy is noted an alternative product not containing the allergen will be recommended Kristine A Romaine dermatologist Lip Overload I had a patient who after injections of Juvederm in her lips and nasolabial folds became swollen There was no bruising bleeding pain or redness just a swollen upper lip Luckily her lips resolved on their own over a few days I believe the swelling was due to blockage of the lymph vessels from her lips and when this resolved and the swelling went down she looked great I still see her for injections but we have not done her lips again I think she s still a bit freaked out Joseph Grzeskiewicz plastic surgeon Botched Boobs One of my patients had a breast augmentation done by an nonboard certified cosmetic surgeon Within days she developed severe scar tissue making her breasts hard asymmetrical and painful She also had a really hard time finding tops to wear that could totally cover her up Her original doctor did not offer her any reasonable solutions to her problem I removed her implants and performed a reconstruction and she is now doing much better Andrew Smith plastic surgeon A Broken Down Smile I had a female patient in her early s who had orthodontic treatments three times before getting veneers and crowns which her previous dentist had made bulky and large Because her upper teeth were so big they moved her lower teeth This also forced her bite to collapse which lead to a loss of support on her front teeth and pressure on her back teeth She had cracked broken molars and could not chew food properly We had to do a full mouth rehabilitation which allowed me to create a healthy natural looking smile that functioned well She ended up with the perfect smile for her face Niloufer Hamsayeh dentist Hard to Remove Lumps and Bumps Recently I had a patient who had six syringes of hyaluronic acid filler injected into her cheek by another doctor She formed a disfiguring reaction that had persisted for two years without any success in dissolving them We were fortunate to finally dissolve them with a combination of enzymes steroids and antibiotics to get her cheek looking normal again Hooman Khorsani dermatologist Red Inflamed Gums A patient came to me who had four porcelain veneers done a few months before and was experiencing bleeding gums and pain around the veneers Her gums were severely inflamed and the tissue around the veneers was badly damaged The veneers were also dull and discolored and the patient was not satisfied I removed the veneers using our erbium laser and cleaned up her gums with our YAG laser before placing four brand new handmade porcelain veneers In the end the veneers looked natural and beautiful and her gums healed to a perfect pink color Zachary Linhart dentist Comments

12448,12448,Nowhere is defeat celebrated more passionately than in St √âtienne Although major trophies were won between the late fifties and Les Verts golden age is defined by a series of glorious failures The most mythical of all coming in a European Cup final loss to Bayern Munich thanks St √âtienne fans argue to a legendary Glasgow goal frame While that team led by The Green Angel Dominique Rocheteau may be lacking a true denouement their influence on French football in the lean times of the s became pivotal The symbol of the great St √âtienne team the club s golden age as a whole and the European Cup final loss to Bayern at Hampden Park are Les Poteaux Carr√©s The Square Posts Intense in their pressing and fluid in style Robert Herbin s St √âtienne side may be the greatest team not to win the European Cup and they were cruelly denied that honour in May as at Dominique Bathenay s shot and later Jacques Santini s header both struck the square planks of wood that made up post and bar Two efforts that Les Verts supporters insist would have resulted in goals had the posts been rounded Although Franz Beckenbauer s Munich were two time defending champions the consensus in both the French and Scottish press was that the better team lost and St √âtienne returned home to be paraded along the Champs √âlys√©es in front of tens of thousands as if they were European champions Since Les Poteaux Carr√©s have taken on an almost religious significance for the former mining town of St √âtienne in South Eastern France Swaggering and industrious in equal measure St √âtienne captured French hearts during a string of improbable European comebacks in the early seventies while claiming nine league titles in thirteen seasons between and That great green dynasty however has its origins nearly two decades before Hampden s square posts intervened and can be broadly separated into two eras Robert Herbin the player and Robert Herbin the coach Despite not winning a league title since or indeed finishing in the top three in that time Les Verts ten championships remains a French record A milestone for which the club were awarded the silver star that now crowns their badge Herbin was party to nine of those ten league wins five as a player and four as manager across his quarter of a century stay at the Stade Geoffroy Guichard from to A promising youth talent at Cavigal Nice in the mid fifties Herbin was subject to an array of advances from across France but it was St √âtienne who secured his signature in July thanks to an intervention from Herbin s mother Herbin s father had preferred OGC Nice Champions for the first time earlier that year St √âtienne were already atop the French game as the year old Herbin arrived in Loire complete with a thick mop of auburn hair that would later morph into his distinctive wispy ginger afro Herbin who eventually became captain would later signal the acceleration of that success winning two further cups in the next five seasons although he would have to wait for his first league title something he initially did not imagine doing When I set foot in Saint √âtienne in with my cardboard suitcase Herbin told Le Progr√®s I thought that I would not stay two years It was not the city of today If I stayed it was because the club had ambitions Across two spells as coach in the mid fifties and mid sixties Jean Snella would nurture the younger Herbin then a tough but technically gifted defensive midfielder We had a father son relationship Herbin later said of Snella who became a mentor and would continue to counsel Herbin into his coaching career Although Snella would lead Les Verts to their second title incredibly doing so as a promoted club in after one season in the second tier it would be the legendary French coach Albert Batteux who would propel Herbin and St √âtienne forward It was Batteux who masterminded the dominant Stade de Reims side of the fifties featuring Raymond Kopa latterly part of Real Madrid s European cup winning teams and Just Fontaine whose record haul of goals carried France then also managed by Batteux to third place at the World Cup in Sweden Their run was only halted by eventual champions Brazil and a second half hat trick from a year old Pel√© Batteux s Reims the first great dynasty of French football to which Herbin s St √âtienne are emotional successors won five league titles between and Only twice did Reims finish outside the top three in that spell adding a Coupe de France win in and appearing in the and European Cup finals losing to Madrid on both occasions Having left Reims and resurfacing unsuccessfully at relegated Grenoble it was Batteux who would lead the first great St √âtienne era Dropping Herbin back into defence allowing the now experienced campaigner to organise play from the back proved a turning point for both club and player as Batteux s Champagne football took hold Powerful Malian goalscorer Salif Keita was added to complement the unpredictability of forward Rachid Mekhloufi as ASSE won three consecutive titles under Batteux between and capturing a brace of French cups along the way Despite the majority of the club s iconic moments coming under his stewardship as coach in the seventies Herbin continues to rate Batteux s St √âtienne of Keita Mekhloufi and himself as Les Verts zenith She is beautiful this team Superb I loved it Herbin explained to Le Progr√®s We were imbued with this idea of

It was sunning itself on the side of the track and rapidly made it's way to shelter in a crevasse of an overhang. In fact I saw it's head first and was expecting something no bigger that 3' or smaller. I was very surprised at it's length. EDIT - further research suggests an Eastern Brown, however, most brown snakes I have seen are much thicker through the body. I haven't seen an olive coloured one although I know they do vary a lot in colouration. Python / Brown - definitely don't want to get them mixed up!

1751,1751,"""The Colorado Milky Way"" Follow me on Instagram = Krispy303 For this shoot I had the pleasure to finally meet Alex Mcgregor. We had talked for over a year about the Milky Way and different ways we approach our shoots. This night was freezing and I think the temperature was about 5 degrees Fahrenheit. I packed up all my gear and left about 12am to get to this destination. The clouds were hanging just over where the Milky Way was suppose to be. I had arrived early about 1:30am or so. I decided to sleep in the back on my car covered in my ski jacket and wearing my snow pants. I was really hoping the clouds would clear. To my surprise they cleared up as soon as Alex arrived. The snow was deep and we had to tread carefully but we got to the spot we wanted. As we were leaving we noticed it looked like it was snowing in our headlamps but there were no clouds. How was this possible? We realized it was very humid for being 5 degrees out and the moisture was freezing right before our eyes. It added a cool disco effect to our headlamps as we were walking. All my gear was frozen solid after this shoot. Exif.

I use a beauty blender with my BB cream and I do really like that.On that note, how often do you replace your beauty blender?¬†Concealer- I've used NARS for years but decided to switch to Two Faced Born This Way Concealer after reading the rave reviews. Again, it's a lot more full coverage than I'm used to. I think it works well with the CC cream but might be too much with a lighter BB cream? Does that make sense at all? Should I get a second, lighter concealer for a BB cream (or tinted moisturizer?)¬†I got a sample of DE baby facial. I used it Sunday and thought it was fine. I have pretty good skin and it's not easily irritated. I did a thin layer after I washed my face and set the timer for 20 minutes. I think I was expecting awesome results but I didn't really notice anything. Maybe my layer was too thin? How do you use it? I use Retin A nearly nightly (I didn't use after the baby facial.)¬†I think that's it for now! I'm pushing 40 and wanting to ""up"" my makeup game Thanks!!!¬†Thought I would chime in!Add half a pump of the cc cream to your morning moisturizer and stipple it on with a brush. Then use you blender to tap it in and grab any excess!Concealer- NARS is my fav. I would grab another and use the too faced one when you need more coverage.I replace my sponges every 6 months and wash them every few days.

Or warheads, just build a stalk of blocks to hold it, blow it up then u just extend the same stalk further this time and use a new warhead. If its gotta be a drill rig, then you can stabalise it by putting all the storage and some heavy armour blocks at the rear to offset the weight of the drills, with sorters to make sure all the cargo is pushed there, i have to do that wilth my bulldozer. For transporting the rock i got a couple , dump the stone directly out of the drill rig and let it roll back down to collectors. Second is i saw a rig that welded a floor as it dug the tunnel. So maybe have it weld a floor with collectors in it then as you go just dump the ston onto the floor and the collectors will keep hold of it. Struggling to think how you would weld a conveyor tube with it because it would be one block deeper under the floor. But maybe that could be a job for after its dug, just let the collectors hold onto it for now. Last would be a second vehicle that links to the first at the rear with connectors. You drag that like a train as you drill then when its full stop the drill rig, disconnect it and drive it out. Then reverse it back in, hook it up and continue drilling fromn the front rig.

8105,8105,In the st century there are so many articles that group specific similar shows together and ask fans which they thought were the best show Loyal fans on both sides will explain the convoluted intricacies of each show as though it was the greatest series ever made while the other side will do the same Sadly in most cases there really is not a clear answer even for those who are fans of both shows RELATED The Addams Family The Darkest Things Wednesday Has Ever Done The same can be said of The Munsters and The Addams Family Both shows had a memorable cast of characters who unlike many TV sitcom characters gets funnier with time While a definitive winner of which was the overall better show cannot be determined let us name a few categories and see who had the upper hand in each Which Family Is The Most Eccentric This could conceivably go both ways but since the Addam s family are made up of humans who do not traditionally behave in such a morbid fashion while the Munsters are monsters whose behavior is quite ordinary for their kind the Addams family has to win this category Both families were quite unaware of how other people conceived them In fact in their eyes it was they who were dealing with the oddballs of society However it just can not be overstated that a family of death obsessed humans seems stranger than it does for a family of monsters Who Has The Creepier House This category has to go to The Munsters for no other reason than their house was planted right in the center of Southern California While the Addams family lived in a secluded area that housed their own graveyard A creepy home near a cemetery in the middle of nowhere would definitely be a place that other people would stay away from but as for those living near the Munster s the very sight of the home would have to bring chills down their spine especially when compared to the normal middle class neighborhood that surrounded them Which Family Had The Better Home Decor The Addams family s mansion housed torture chambers bear rugs that growled and ghostly armored knights that would come alive long enough to chop someone s head off if they were not careful While the Munster s house was your typical dilapidated mansion with a fair amount of cobwebs and a few secret doors It was a place people would expect to find creatures of their caliber RELATED Of The Best Addams Family Quotes It did have a few unique characteristics like the gargoyles that made the scary noises but besides that it just did not exhibit the macabre that the Addams house oozed Who Had The Scarier Pets Most people would think that having a pet lion roaming through a house has to be the hands down winner of scariest pet Though that is until they are reminded that the Munster s house had a pet dragon living underneath their stairs So this category has to go to The Munsters even though The Addam s Family have a list of frightening household pets such as an octopus lion and a pet spider If this category was who had the most assortment of strange pets the winner would be reversed Sadly this category is more quality over quantity Who Were The More Authentic Parents The Munsters win this category because Lilly and Herman Munster were not weird for weird sake instead they actively tried to fit in with their normal neighbors Though sadly they were never successful Not to mention that their struggles were more realistic Especially when it comes to them actively trying to participate in the community only to be shunned or bullied by those around them Gomez and Morticia Addams seemed to live in their own little bubble with their children Unlike the Munster s who tried desperately to have their son fit in with society Which Had More Lasting Appeal As for lasting appeal that went beyond its initial show the winner has to be The Addams Family Over the past half century The Addams Family has spawned four major movies a popular cartoon series along with a few modern attempts at a television adaption of the original RELATED Horror Movies On Netflix To Watch Before Halloween The Munsters have tried to recreate the magic that was in the original series but after a few made for television movies along with an animated cartoon movie in the spark has never been recreated An attempt to make a st century TV adaption was started but never made it to air Which Show Had Better Side Characters The Addams Family is the victor in this category because it does have a few memorable characters that have become household names in American pop culture Cousin Itt is known as nothing more than a wad of hair wearing a bowler hat His speech is indistinguishable but that is partly what makes him a fun character While Thing is an animated hand that helps the Addams family with their chores The Munsters had a number of side characters such as Mrs Cribbins and Charlie Munster that were popular additions but did not stick in viewers imaginations More Appealing To Average Viewers Of The Time In a time where wholesome TV sitcoms were not only expected but basically required The Addams Family sticks out like a sore thumb They hardly did anything that average families of the time were doing In a way The Addams Family would be considered a show geared towards millionaires which oddly enough was exactly what this particular television family were However The Munsters outside of their features had the same values as the average American household They like many other families enjoyed going to baseball games and the movies So this category goes to The Munsters Better Theme Song It is hard to compare the theme songs of both sitcoms partly because they are so conventionally different The Munsters had a rather updated theme song for its time along with a funny intro of the cast of characters rummaging out of the house It was a nice introduction that helped introduce fans to the Munster family RELATED s Movies That Need A Reboot That said The Addams Family theme song has to win this category on the grounds that their theme song has a more catchy flow with actual words to the song Both were great theme songs but only one can win Who Incorporates The Outside World Better Because of their wealth The Addams Family could live in luxury with all the finer things in life Their house was actually closer to that of a mansion and because of its size and all the stuff they had fit in it there really was no need for them to ever be seen outside However because the Munsters family were a working class family they tried often unsuccessfully to fit into the neighborhood Other locations were seen throughout filming making it more unique in that it wasn t just the same setting over and over again Point goes to The Munsters NEXT Last Man Standing Things Fans Need To Know About Molly Ephraim The post Things The Addams Family Does Better Things The Munsters Does Better appeared first on TV and Movie News

10054,10054,Editor s note This as told to from Phil Jackson was originally published in the May issue of ESPN The Magazine In what appears to be the final season of the Chicago Bulls s reign coach Phil Jackson has periodically collected his thoughts and analyzed the swirling action around him Beginning with a preseason trip to Paris and then later often while relaxing at his desk at the Bulls Deerfield Ill training complex surrounded by the books and mementos that have become so meaningful to him Jackson never seems rattled by the crazy activity that surrounds his team which opens the playoffs as the favorite to win its sixth title in eight years These are Jackson s reflections on what he believes is the last running of these Bulls IT S OCTOBER and here we are at the McDonald s Championship in a tournament with F C Barcelona PSG Racing Benetton Treviso Olympiakos Piraeus and Atenas de C√≥rdoba the best pro teams the rest of the world can muster This is our reward for having won the NBA championship last June our fifth title in seven years In certain ways it s not much of a reward We won Game of the Finals against the Utah Jazz just four months ago and our offseason seems to have vanished overnight But I have walked throughout the area near our hotel by the Seine and Paris is a beautiful place Still we are here to play basketball to win We are the Bulls But we are weak We are playing without Dennis Rodman who has not signed a contract yet and without Scottie Pippen who just underwent foot surgery Our usual sixth man Toni Kukoc is playing a lot for us but he is far out of shape because he spent the entire summer resting his injured foot But we have great pride and we are not about to become the first NBA team to lose a game in the years of this tournament Above all we have our one supreme warrior Michael Jordan He has not missed a game regular season exhibition or playoff since he returned to the Bulls from his baseball experiment in the spring of He will not lose Every time he moves people scream and flashbulbs explode Of course he is named the MVP of the tournament Paris all of Europe the world loves him The only dark spot is the resonance of the words of our vice president of basketball operations Jerry Krause who said recently that coaches and players do not win championships organizations win championships He would say that Michael says he will not come back after this season to play for the Bulls unless I am the coach but I signed a one year deal and the Bulls definitely have plans to hire another coach for next year Probably Tim Floyd of Iowa State This is what Michael said It s a bad way to end an unbelievable run IT S THE MIDDLE of November which means the circus comes to the United Center and we have to leave for our extended West Coast trip always a tough haul Just the other day I had to stand in front of the amassed media people lights blinding me and explain why we had just lost to Cleveland and Washington I tried to use humor to soften my words but I also tried to give the people a serious look at the reality of our team We are not that talented and we sure are not young and we had finished a nine month season just days ago Plus we were still playing without Pippen But afterward my wife June told me that the press was ripping into my coaching job and feasting on the Bulls dead carcass After practice Thursday a couple of beat writers caught me as I was going to my office One of them said I heard from a source that you and Michael had words after the loss to the Wizards It wasn t true but that s what you deal with when you lose I did not know what to do to improve our scoring but I began to toy with the idea of starting Kukoc against teams with bigger shooting forwards That would give us a kind of three guard lineup of Michael Ron Harper and Toni since Toni is so versatile and used to play the point in Europe We need somebody to help Michael when teams unabashedly double and triple team him While I was thinking about this in the video room Steve Kerr came limping in He had taken a fall against the Wizards and I had not thought much of it Now his leg was wired to a stimulator and wrapped in ice Our trainer Chip Schaefer told me there was a slight crack in Kerr s femur Oh boy Later Krause told me he had signed a kid he liked from the CBA to take Kerr s place With the West Coast trip at hand I went to the bookstore to shop for books to give to each player coach and of course Chip I gave the new players copies of the book I wrote a couple years ago Sacred Hoops so they could get a feel for my thinking background and the principles of the triangle offense For the vets I got books by authors I had bought for them before Harp got another Walter Mosley mystery Michael and Scottie were easy because they do not read It did not matter what I bought them Kerr and Chip need stimulating stuff because they are both big readers But what should I do about Krause He does not have a lot of interests except sports experts and fishing I considered Any Idiot Can Manage and How To Be an Enlightened Team Builder but thought that would be a slap in the face I turned down an aisle and June said Do not get him a book The Krauses let us know how they feel last Christmas when they did not get us anything I felt bad for a moment because Jerry likes so much to be included But in the end I did not buy him anything because I could not find it in myself to give him something of value All of a sudden we are I have not given up hope but other teams sense blood We miss Scottie and the guys are not in sync But we are still the Bulls In L A a baby faced Tiger Woods is waiting in the crowd for Michael We are staying at the Hilton instead of the Marina del Rey where we usually stay I choose hotels on our trips no questions asked but this one was dropped on us with no explanation So I ask Krause and he says We had a previous deposit here that we had to use And I figure that means Jerry Reinsdorf the principal owner of both the Bulls and the White Sox had done something Who were these reservations made for a basketball or a baseball team After dinner I ride the elevator with some punked out kids who tell me the band downstairs is playing for Dennis Rodman and if he likes them he is going to sponsor them whatever that means I hear the bass thumping until a m In Seattle Scottie who is still on injured reserve tells some reporters he wants to be traded that he s not going to play for the Bulls ever again I figure he s just feeling his oats momentarily ticked off about his horrible contract that pays him less than probably a hundred players in the league But on the bus ride from the airport to the hotel he tears into Krause from the back Usually Michael is the one who showers Krause with ridicule But now Scottie is giving serious abuse Hey Jerry he yells You going to sign me to a contract or trade me It gets so bad I have to turn around and stare at Scottie The next day at practice Scottie runs well but he does not have much gas And as he talks to the press afterward he says that after all he had done for the team he can not stand being treated with so little respect and he can not see himself ever wearing a Bulls uniform again But that night on the bench he is dressed to the nines in a gray pinstriped suit and boxed toe shoes and he cheers wildly especially for Kukoc who is taking his place Still we lose our fourth close game of the season and I do not know what is going on In the past we were always the ones who won the close ones My sleep is suffering On Thanksgiving I am thrilled to be at home with four of my five kids all the ones who are in college Earlier in the day after practice I was able to get our resident team therapist to come in and talk to Scottie He helped Scottie articulate his anger but did not challenge his thinking About midnight Scottie calls and we talk a long time He is dead serious I try to reason with him about the timing of his demands and the fact that he can not control his destiny I tell him not to let his anger toward management destroy his desire to help lead this remarkable team He counters that he can not let management break his heart I go to bed totally depressed The kids come in from partying at a m full of energy I remind myself that life is short I have to let this pain go Now we are and in eighth place in the Eastern Conference We are playing for the last time against the Wizards in the doomed Cap Centre USAir Arena a hideous suburban building that reminds me of a beached and rotting whale I hate this dark dank place so much that we do not even have our usual shootaround but simply meet in a Georgetown hotel room The team seems mired in depression looking at the season with despair I have work to do PIPPEN S FOOT INJURY is worse than people know He basically has not played in half a year not since he hurt himself in the championships last June Our strength coach Al Vermeil worked Scottie out today and was stunned to find his vertical leap is only inches That s the same as Joe Kleine s Scottie s used to be inches or so His leg strength is shot So now we are looking at another month or more of rehab I did not like the way Michael was running in tonight s game He was tired and his hips were starting to wobble So I took him out But then he said he wanted to go back in so I let him That s the kind of relationship we have Respect I sometimes think about Michael him with a cigar before a critical game He will be calmly confident smiling saying Do not worry we will beat these guys I get my own peace from meditating from my Zen Christian beliefs I sit for minutes every day in a meditative position I can not cross my legs because of arthritis but in three or four breaths I can get to the relaxed state It s a way to let your mind rest so your mind does not control your day All the players sit in a group and try to do it Some go willingly some do not But they do it as a group because they know it s important and it s important to me Ten minutes at the most Eyes slightly open sitting in chairs Lights down a little You d like to hear your heart beat but not concentrate on it Some guys are now doing it on their own It s an unbelievable force No religion No nothing It s stress management But right now at Christmas time it is hard for me June and I have been having discussions about our future together and sometimes I think back and wonder why I got into coaching at all after my playing days Other teams have already interviewed me for their head coaching job The Knicks Seattle others I laugh when I think about first coming to the Bulls when I was interviewed by Stan Albeck to be an assistant I came from Puerto Rico and I was wearing a flowered shirt and a big straw hat with a parrot feather in it So it started there and now I am a coach I have missed some things that my kids did because of my job but I can not hold onto that In Zen you give that up you have to be here for what you can do at this moment Do not get too high do not get too low Tonight we beat the Los Angeles Lakers at home really got to them Michael had points He was into it he could have had points but I rested him He was guarded sometimes by Eddie Jones who s a terrific player People say we should trade Scottie for Jones but there s nobody who can replace Scottie Pippen There are only two players who could possibly do the things he does Grant Hill and Penny Hardaway But Scottie is best for us Sometimes in a film session I get upset and wonder what we are doing why we can not put it together consistently The other day I stopped the film after watching Luc Longley screw up again and I just said Everybody makes mistakes And I made one coming back here with this team this year I meant it in sort of a light hearted way But then Michael says Me too So it weighed pretty heavy on everyone Later on in the session Luc says kind of to everyone in the dark It s easy to criticize He was hurt Then Tex Winter jumped in and said Luc I do not understand you You do not have the right attitude A shrug is a big deal for Luc he is a loveable guy But he says to Tex I wasn t talking about the coaching staff Michael is the one being critical I just want to let him know it s easy to criticize And then Michael says The only thing that upsets me is when we lose I think you should resolve to make yourself better the next time Change The room was charged It was somber Michael was somber He does not play cards with the guys like he used to He is serious He has not smiled a genuine smile in two weeks He s letting everyone know it s time He said It s over We are not gonna lose anymore I am sick of losing too What are we We should be We lost games in the entire season I do not talk a whole lot to Michael during games and I do not look at him on the court much either I just have a feel for him He will let me know by making a signal a fist or tap his chest when he wants to come out But the other night I went down and patted him on the knee while he was on the bench just to let him know we are with him We have been having a little family turmoil and some of it saddens me But I am not depressed I feel I have every right to be happy in this life I look around my office and all of the things in here the Native American artifacts the signs the photos of the Dalai Lama and the Southwest inspire me Like those bull horns up there on the wall Johnny Bach gave me that He even painted my name on it With the bull s testicles in the pouch tied in between That inspires me And that photo of Michael and me hugging after the third NBA title It looks like we are crying but that s champagne But I did cry with B J Armstrong after that I had to really push him during that playoff He had to play Mookie Blaylock full court Kevin Johnson full court He has such a sweet temperament but he worked so hard he was basically exhausted He collapsed when Paxson made the winning shot against Phoenix He was spent We laughed about it later but he leaned against me and we cried DENNIS RODMAN IS doing a terrific job rebounding unbelievable for a guy who is years old But people do not appreciate that this guy is a court jester He s a heyoka a backward walking man from Indian culture Those guys walked backward rode horses backward wore women s clothes made people laugh He will come in when the team is a little glum I mean here is a man with a big yellow happy face on his hair then a festive multi colored Christmas do I wish you could see this Christmas card that Dennis sent to me It s a photograph of him with a little smile dressed up as an angel complete with wings and gown He s our jester And the team understands They are old enough and mature enough to know that there is latitude for certain individuals A lot of teams could not handle it I have had a little problem recently with Jason Caffey being pouty about lack of playing time He talked to the press he s a little out of sorts So I got on him Then I find out a relative of his was shot and killed down in Alabama the other night But he has to stay focused on his role It can be a problem if bench players get upset Randy Brown got grumpy about it last year but you have to keep it from affecting the team Scottie is getting close to playing shape but now he has a problem having said that he will never play for the Bulls again I told him on Sunday to put it on the back burner How can he go back on his word Easy Just say that his teammates have come to him with the notion of playing for ourselves for another title L A s not going to trade for him It will be a bad team like the Warriors or somebody like that Look what happened to Tom Gugliotta when he went to the Warriors I told Scottie he needs to be on a team that plays team ball He s had four operations He s got a bad back He s been through a lot I do not question the migraines he used to get He s a warrior What he has to do soon is get back invested in this team He loves Chicago It s his home Michael still feels so bad about things that he s not holding the breakfast club he had every morning where Scottie and Harper work out at Michael s house take a steam and they all go have breakfast It has been over a third of a season since we have played without the man who does the little things that hold this team together More on The Last Dance Watch replays of Episodes and Stephen A Smith Scottie Pippen s deal should have been redone Dennis Rodman details the demise of the Chicago Bulls Why Michael Jordan objected to Dennis Rodman going to Las Vegas I HAVE SO many cigars I do not know what to do with them all Dennis gave me a bunch for Christmas and people just hand them to me They also send me religious objects sacred things crucifixes religious books But this tobacco is like a whole ritual I used to smoke a pipe in college I had a great collection And there were the pipe stems and the tamper and the special lighter and it was quite a process But now we have cigars And I have Dennis He s been missing practices or just showing up late Dennis is playing very well when he is focused and not bored I feel he has attention deficit disorder and has a hard time concentrating on anything for too long He had rebounds in two games against the Knicks and the Mavericks And against San Antonio two nights ago he had a wonderful game guarding two seven footers David Robinson and Tim Duncan It just astounds me how he can do that But after the game he said I took a hell of a beating I should not have to go to practice I said It s at noon You can make it there by noon And he said What if I do not come And I said I will fine you Triple That s nothing it s just three times But he showed up He was late but he showed up The thing was he was losing interest Not in practice but in basketball generally One day he did not show up at all He lives so close he could walk to the Berto Center in minutes So I sent somebody over to get him and Dennis was there eating Sugar Pops from a bowl and he said I can not make it Can not do it So I went over there later and he was there on his mattress on the floor in front of a huge TV screen that almost fills a wall with an immense stack of videos I told him It s a downhill shot from here It gets easier The playoffs are coming The point is Dennis has to get his motor going himself What is helping now is this relationship he s started with Carmen Electra whoever she is Is she on TV And she is his inspiration He goes out and plays for her But God forbid he has a bad game because then it s impotence time Toni has started or games but he s not happy either He s been bitchy and whiny The guys tell me he has not been in a good mood I just keep asking him to get his mind where ours is He wants to start so I can not figure out why he s unhappy Harper diminishes his game for the good of the group but Toni is sort of a maverick That irritates me but I think in a way we need a maverick somebody who can just go off on his own His biggest tendency is to look for a different play than the obvious one He will try to make miraculous passes to the most unimaginable places Scottie started playing on Jan our th game I started him easy against the Warriors and he s been getting better and better We are now Luc s got a bone bruise in his knee that just will not heal We are doing well without him but I need him tomorrow night against Indiana against Rik Smits Smits is just too tall for Dennis Jerry Krause called me into his office the other day He was reading a book about the Bulls and he came to a page where I described his brusque nature He did not like it but I went and got my dictionary and it says for brusque curt offhand and I said that s appropriate I am a courteous person but if he puts me on the carpet like that I have to say something What Jerry loves to do is draft to get players But he gets rid of Jason Caffey and all he gets are two draft picks second round NBA basketball is not about drafting anymore it s about free agents Still these guys love to do their drafting It s Jerry s baby I remember Michael Finley came in before the draft Jerry felt he could not shoot very well But he scored against us on March and we lost to the Mavericks in overtime That was a game in which we never trailed during regulation They did not lead for one moment We were ahead by eight with less than a minute to play It s amazing we lost but actually it was great for us The Orlando Magic did that to us just before we went on to win our last championship in the Chicago Stadium Nick Anderson hit a bank shot at the buzzer and that sparked us to get our s together You get tired at the end of the season But you have to complete the game NOW WE are PLAYING well I think we can achieve our goal of wins but Michael is tired I think he got really fatigued at the All Star Game and has not fully recovered But I will let him skip a practice or two and see if that helps Luc is out with his knee problem and Toni has a bad left foot But we have continued to win without them The thing is we are going to need Luc against big guys like Greg Ostertag and Shaq in the playoffs and maybe Patrick Ewing if he comes back for the Knicks But the biggest thing we need to do is not let the other team be the aggressor the way Cleveland was when they beat us April there We could be just a little short of weapons unless we get everybody healthy Things get funny at the end of the season The Seattle Sonics losing in San Antonio with David Robinson out for the Spurs And who would have predicted Denver which looked so pathetic would get to wins They looked like a team that could lose them all But that s how it is finding a way Attrition teams getting on a roll Some guys just have fried brains They hit the wall Right now I am sitting here getting ready to splice together the video I always make before we play our first playoff foe The shortest one I have ever made was an hour so they are pretty substantial I use footage of our opponents and I sprinkle in messages from other films This year I have got Higher Learning directed by John Singleton with Laurence Fishburne Mother Jugs Speed with Raquel Welch Harvey Keitel and Bill Cosby playing ambulance chasers and Squibnocket a James Taylor concert recorded in his barn on Martha s Vineyard Should be a good one For my own entertainment I am reading some astonishing books Suttree by Cormac McCarthy and Blood Meridian also by him They are both dark I do not like his theme or tone Blood Meridian is so dark I do not know where he went down to to get there But the language amazing And Underworld by Don DeLillo pages and I can not bring myself to read the last A whole week and I can not do it I do not want to finish it It s wonderful But it s having a real effect on me It s about so many things America transition Bobby Thomson s home run marriage nuclear families neighborhoods East Coast West Coast art trash I can put a book aside and say this truly resonated for me or this makes sense Books make me think of the other part of me I do not have a TV in Montana where we have a summer house And the living there is so much better My days are better My mornings are fresher My life feels healthier It would last year round too I know I am seriously thinking about getting out It s an option after this season but I d have to find another career another job I am not financially set Maybe I would be if I were a single man but not to support an entire family There was a moment way back when I retreated from the other world the high pressure world I started a small business in Montana for a couple of years then I came back to this world I started back very low profile Coaching in the CBA But I just had more and more and more success and it led to where I am now I remember my old Knicks teammate Dave DeBusschere saying at his bar in Manhattan in I d be happiest being a truck driver But I can not I gotta go for the money It was that conversation that sent me to Montana Now I have been sucked back into this world But I have another opportunity to check out Or stay in I could step out for a year But then if someone like the Lakers comes after me and wants me to coach a team that s ready to pursue a championship what can I do I have to admit I watched a little of the Lakers on TV last night They lost at home to Phoenix I watched Shaq and he got taken out of the game for committing his fourth foul a brutish kind of foul because he was angry He comes to the bench and he s arguing with Del Harris the coach Del is saying You can not do that And Shaq is saying What the f you mean I can not The f ing ref did not call a foul at the other end Harris says Does not matter Shaq can not get it through his head It did not frighten me but it was a warning signal Is this kid smart enough yet to know what he can and can not do in this game to become a winner I see that as a challenge But the challenge also would be to have him submit to the triangle offense And I believe in its principles It s nothing more than overloading one side of the floor It s a center in offense And here with the Bulls we never really had that center It s amazing Who s the perfect center for the triangle Shaq SHAQ Throw the ball in to this guy what s the defense going to do But we play with what we have And we are playing without people and winning Which is a credit to our players and their attitude So will I be back I told Mr Reinsdorf last year I do not feel comfortable working with Jerry Krause because he bailed out on me back when I signed my first one year deal two years ago The truth is I did not know if I wanted to continue coaching here I wanted to coach seven years Now it s nine Coaches salaries have skyrocketed in the last two years But this is our last year we are playing it out For Michael Scottie Dennis Steve Luc Jud Buechler a couple others this is it We want to make this a good finale because I think after this season we will be split up We are doing a private ceremony before our last regular season game We are closing this down Michael has said he will not play for another coach We have a rhythm a flow But it s ending Three years ago we could not predict could not project that Jordan and Rodman would compete like this at the age they are Nobody has seen anything like it We did not predict it I sure did not I told Jerry Krause I had never seen a great guard play at a high level after age And now Michael is If I leave and he retires because of that I guess it will affect the NBA But Michael and I have talked about our futures and he said Phil you do what you have to do And I said Michael please do not let your decision revolve around me We both dialed off on it Anyway we have other things to think about Like trying to win a sixth title Rick Telander a former senior writer for

3571,3571,"Sazabi posted: Finally got a day off without the rain. And had some really successful test runs. Couple of quick questions. Do you always need to prime to prevent mistakes? Is their a primer for clear parts? I had some trouble with a gold basically going on okay but just falls off the part or shifts off of areas to collect in a corner. Can paint expire or go bad? Is gray or black primer preferred for certain colors/paints? Or is it possible to mess up a project if I use say gray primer for a metalic black and blue design. Lastly: Is there a theme or rules for the 30 min March contest? Thanks for the help/support thread. You should always prime there is, to the best of my knowledge, no such thing as transparent primer. I don't even know how that would work It sounds like you're either putting it on way too thick or over thinning it It can solidify, but there's ways to stave that off. Putting a bb in the pot will help you shake it up, and in extreme cases a nail polish shaker can bring thickened paint back from the grave. But that's like, if you leave it open over night or if the paint's really old Generally primer color doesn't matter. White black and grey are preferred just because they're neutral. But if you're painting something a very light color like white or yellow, you probably want a lighter primer because if you use a darker primer it can take a lot of coats to completely cover it up. I've never heard of anybody having problems with dark colors over a light primer though. lastly: Build a 30 Minute Missions kit. You can build it just as it is out the box, kitbash it, paint it, whatever. As long as you're building a 30 Minute Missions kit, you're in."

4464,4464,"Originally Posted by thehumblegringo Yep and that why we hoofed the ball forward against Man City, Preston, Fulham, Mansfield home, Sheffield Wednesday and Bolton away too cos they all play exactly like Millwall!!! We played that way cos that is how we play. We play Patterson in midfield cos we don't have any desire to play through the midfield. We played Peltier there against QPR ffs. We clearly have completely polarised views when it comes to football but in my opinion you're probably only saying these things cos it's Cardiff City. You're like a a guy whose missus is shagging all your mates but you're so blinded you think she can do no wrong! And you are like a guy who's team are fourth in the league with a good chance of promotion, when everyone predicted that they would finish mid table at best, who thinks that they can do no right and is constantly wittering on about the standard of football they are playing. If you look back to your earlier posts you clearly state that this year Warnock has gone backwards compared to last year and thats absolute rubbish looking at the league table and points gained. Peltier played in midfield against QPR because we didnt have anyother players available due to injuries. For your sake lets hope that we dont get promotion this season as you probably couldnt stomach the success based on such an abysmal level of performance and there would be much wailing and hand wringing on how we dont deserve to be there."
4021,4021,"This is a great tool for someone in a condo or apartment. It has great suction, useful attachments, and the powered cleaning head is a very useful feature. I vacuumed the master bedroom with it, then came back with my Dyson and there was virtually nothing in the dust bin of the full-size vac afterward. This brings me to my first complaint (more observation than complaint); the dust bin capacity is a bit small to use in a home much larger than 1200 sq feet without having to empty it partway through. At least it was in my case. For what it\u2019s worth, we do have 2 dogs shedding their fur and tracking dirt in all day. Its size makes it easy to store and carry from room to room, but that also means there\u2019s nowhere to store the attachments. It would be nice if it came with a mesh or nylon bag to keep everything together. I really like this vacuum overall. It\u2019s powerful, not too heavy, and I think it\u2019s a perfect gift for someone just getting started in their own place."

Unless you use a special cable that is wired for balanced in and out to connect to an unbalanced send/return 1//4"" jack, all hell will break loose. The iD22 does not seem to have a downloadable user manual. Usually, the mic input on interfaces of this type have 0 gain when all the way down, effectively making it a ""Line"" input. I would connect the Mic Pre One with a mic cable to the mic input on the iD22 and turn the gain all the way down. That should work, Geoff Thanks Geoff i guess that makes sense. I still have the question of why the id22 seems to work fine with other balanced output preamps (great river, vintech73, golden age premiere) when i use the return instead of the combo jack. i tried the combo jack and it does make the gain more usable without engaging the pad on the daking. Just cant wrap my mind around the id22 return jack being the issue when this problem never showed up with my other pres and same mics. Plus i want to truly bypass the id22. Thats one of the main reasons i purchased it and i understand thr combo jack doesnt achieve this Thanks. Oh i did a few more sessions last night and it does sound really good. Different flavor than the 1073 styles. Gave me less low mid buildup and a clear recording."

virtually any food I could possibly want at any time of day I work in downtown Manhattan and live in North Brooklyn In my entire waking life I am never more than five blocks away from an artisanal salted butterscotch cookie So the fact that I speed walk to the subway on Fridays panicked over whether or not I will make it before all the bagels are gone Note The bagels are never gone is just further proof that years of dieting have made me banana pants It s a simple equation My body is used to the cycle of deprivation and indulgence and my mind is riddled with food insecurity Since I have spent my whole life teaching myself that bagels are The Untouchable Carb it s no wonder I act like a maniac when faced with a kitchen full of them On a normal day eating a bagel would never even occur to me I have my breakfast blinders on and life revolves around high fiber low fat and all the things I absolutely would not want to eat But Fridays were a different story On Fridays I did not really have a choice did I The bagels were there so free and so bountiful More importantly everyone was eating them so it must be okay right This was an opportunity I could not miss I had to take advantage and stock up for who knows what could happen tomorrow I could be hit by a bus never having tasted that last processed carbohydrate Or more likely as my traumatized appetite knew I could just go back to my normal bagel less existence Advertisement Photographed by Ruby Yeh This is one lesson that takes a lot of practice to learn When I committed to Intuitive Eating I was ready to let go of my bagel neurosis You know you can have a bagel on Tuesday if you want one right my Intuitive Eating specialist Theresa Kinsella asked me in one of our early sessions I mean yeah I mean no And you do not have to have one on Friday if you do not want one Oh I know ARE YOU A F CKING MANIAC It took about iterations of this conversation before I really really really got it And then one morning I left the gym and realized I wanted a bagel on a Tuesday It was such a shock that I literally stopped walking in the middle of the sidewalk Are you sure you really want a bagel Actually I am But but where would you even get one Do not pull that one on me I will save you the epic tale of my half block journey to find a sesame seed bagel but five minutes later I was at my desk enjoying breakfast like nothing had happened But in fact I d just beaten Last Supper Bagel Friday Syndrome Or at least I d won this round The next challenge would come three days later Friday rolled around and again I paused on my gym to work walk asking myself what I wanted for breakfast still a novel experience for a lifelong dieter But before I could even figure out what I did want I was nearly knocked over by the realization of what I did not I did not want a bagel Now who s the f cking maniac How can you do this to me I am just not really in the mood It sounds too heavy this morning But everyone else will be eating bagels and you will be left out and miserable and then maybe bagels will be abolished tomorrow YOU DON T KNOW Okay you need a time out Let us talk after we have had some eggs It wasn t an instant fix I still have the bagel battle in my brain from time to time There are some foods that are so engrained as Good or Evil in my diet addled mind that it takes a level of hyperconsciousness to really determine whether or not I want to eat them Until now it wasn t about wanting the food so much as what the food meant But bagels do not mean anything They mean flour and water and sesame seeds And that s it As long as I remember that then Bagel Friday will not win As it turns out it was never a war to begin with Or maybe there was but only in my head and I am not that f cking maniac anymore The Anti Diet

I know it's bending the rules a bit, but it's the order I first thought of when I heard of generation lockes. And yeah I thought about that when I was planning the run, and I'm just going to limit myself to Gen 1-4 Pokemon in Rising Ruby. In terms of the ""first encounter, first catch"" rule, I'll just do ""first Gen 1-4 encounter, first catch."" With the amount of grass pokemon per route in that game, it shouldn't be a problem. And for Storm Silver, I'm playing to Lance. It's my favorite game of the bunch, but this locke is long enough already haha."

7242,7242,Disney has been remaking many of its hand drawn animated classics into films that mix live action with innovative CGI The Jungle Book and The Lion King used virtual production to create photorealistic visions of talking and singing animals In Maleficent Mistress of Evil Angelina Jolie was made to look like she was flying through the air while the cast of Mulan was strapped into wires for many gravity defying stunts and Will Smith danced around in a motion capture suit as the Genie in Aladdin Following is a transcript of the video Narrator From motion capture to virtual production Disney has been able to bring everything from the Pride Lands to Agrabah into the real world But trying to translate these classics from hand drawn animation to live action while maintaining everything audiences loved about the originals is never easy Like how do you make a photorealistic lion that can also belt out songs ‚ô™ It means no worries ‚ô™ ‚ô™ For the rest of your days ‚ô™ To see how they did it take a peek at what eight Disney live action remakes looked like behind the scenes Actress Liu Yifei trained for three months about six to seven hours per day to portray Mulan Like here where you can see her preparing for one of the movie s epic sword fights According to cinematographer Mandy Walker the actress did about of her own stunts The cast had to learn everything from martial arts to horseback riding for the action packed film Meanwhile many of the film s gravity defying stunts were achieved with impressive wire work This film featured about different animal species created using groundbreaking CGI There was a key step in the process to making sure all of the animals looked so realistic facial rigging During this stage animators explored what muscles animals have that humans do not By doing that they could ensure the animals would do things like snarl the right way To make sure the animals looked convincing when they talked animators used a combination of human and animal muscles for the characters mouths Another crucial breakthrough had to do with putting hairs on the animals They had to figure out the direction an animal s hair would move how it clumps and how it interacts with the world around it Perhaps most impressive is that Neel Sethi who played Mowgli acted completely alone on set as all the animals were created with CGI and the other stars recorded their voices But he did have a little company Actors in blue suits and crew members held up animal puppets and used googly eyes on their hands like these pesky monkeys that steal food from Mowgli which were later replaced with CGI versions of the animals The Jungle Book paved the way for s The Lion King The film was shot using virtual production which allowed director Jon Favreau and the crew to step into the world they were creating and shoot everything like it was really live action The biggest challenge for the film s visual effects team was creating a photorealistic version of the African savanna while also remaining faithful to the source material Take the part where Rafiki stands and lifts Simba In reality mandrills can not stand up like that So in the new version they animated the character sitting down while lifting Simba into the air And the animals still needed to be able to speak and also sing some of those iconic songs So the animators would try to reposition the animals heads when they could so the audience would not be staring directly into their mouths And they timed the characters breathing to their dialogue and at the same time let the characters belly muscles and diaphragm tighten so it would really like they were letting out air while talking Many CGI dogs were created for this live action remake However the two main stars were real A mutt named Monte played Tramp while a cocker spaniel named Rose played Lady Perhaps nothing was more challenging than filming the most iconic scene from the original when the two dogs share a plate of spaghetti and meatballs This scene took three days to film and while shooting it the noodles kept breaking So instead of using actual noodles they used undyed licorice soaked in chicken broth This ensured that the noodle was strong enough for the take and also that the dogs had something quite tasty to eat The moment where the two dogs snouts touch though That was CGI The elephants were created with masterful visual effects work by MPC Film However the actors still needed something on set to sell the scenes So an actor and a stunt double in green suits stood in for baby Dumbo But first they had to learn to move like a baby elephant which included walking around on all fours using these stilts no easy feat on long shoot days Instead of making the Genie character an entirely CGI creation Will Smith got to fully embody him and his dance moves and it was all captured by a motion capture suit While Aladdin initially received criticism for how the Genie looked in his blue form the movie ended up having him in human form whenever it could And to get a sense of some of the film s impressive stunts just look at the One Jump Ahead sequence While most movies are shot at frames per second some parts of this sequences were shot at a slow motion frames per second while others were shot at an incredibly fast frames per second According to director Guy Ritchie actor Mena Massoud had to make sure he was singing completely in sync So at some parts he had to sing really fast and other parts really slow Mistress of Evil is a sequel to the retelling of Sleeping Beauty from the villain s perspective This movie had to make its titular character and many other characters fly They pulled this off using two different methods The first was using wires a more traditional practical method for lifting up characters in the air The second way was lifting actress Angelina Jolie and the other flying characters up with these two pronged forks The forks are operated by these extras in blue suits that you see back here who would later be turned into CGI backdrops The fork fits onto both sides of a person s body This device gives them mobility and allows them to twist a person around backwards forwards or side to side a degree movement while the actor is safely clamped into place Meanwhile Maleficent s wings were created with CGI While on set Jolie wore these on her back which would later be replaced with wings The visual effects team was tasked with making convincing wings and also making sure those wings moved in sync with the performer s body movements To fully embody the role of Beast actor Dan Stevens wore a motion capture suit on stilts The stilts ensured that the actor was the Beast s appropriate height on set so the actors would be looking at the right spot However they did not just have the characters standing in front of green screens they actually built many of these sets in England and they are impressive Take the ballroom which was made with square feet of faux marble And they payed special attention to the costumes Belle s dress was decorated with about Swarovski crystals and according to actress Emma Watson the costume designers created it so it looked like it was floating as Belle and Beast danced

Sources: ~Snipped~ 't think the effect would be that significant if games are going to be played behind closed doors since that lifts a big pressure from both visiting teams [the current proposal of playing in neutral grounds] and based on the article, their main concern is about having a lot of players and staff flying around the country."

7488,7488,"We stayed in the French village. Room was of accomodating size for our family of 4. My only issue was my 13yr old son couldn't fit on the day bed comfortably. He's 5'9 and requires at least a dbl bed for himself. It would have been ideal for 1king, 1 dbl w dbl trundle. There was definitely enough space in the room for both sizes. A balcony would've also been ideal. The mini bar could've been stocked fuller with more juices as there were 4 of us and only had 2 oj, 2AJ, 2 cranberry.. and the cans were remotely mini. Resort was great, always clean, pools were always open and great temps(except kiddie pool was a bit chilly), always an abundance of chairs and towels. The liquid night club hrs needs to be reevaluated; i feel that from 8pm-9:30pm it should be open for ages 11-15, then 9:30pm -11pm for ages 16-19. My 11yr old daughter missed out cuz she couldn't stay away passed 9pm. Also it would've been cool to have the water park open a bit later through dusk. We did find the lazy river pretty relaxing at times, other times kids/adults were speeding through and pushing through as well as swimming in it without tubes. I dont think that should be ! you wanna horse around, go to a village pool or the ocean.We do want to thank a few of the staff that added an extra flare to our stay. 1st off to the reception staff at French Village for acknowledging our anniversary, the kids loved the treats(hubby/I didnt get any) lol. To Chris @ the mac n' cheese truck, best pulled pork mac n' cheese ever! To Andy in the Loyalty & Travel dep't, funny, helpful and not pushy. Thanks Andy for your hospitality, you truly are a team leader. To Sophia @ Mario's, your smile brightens the room. And finally, to Ricardo & Joseph @ snapshots, thank you for capturing the most memorable moments our family experienced. Our photos are simply perfect.I would definitely come back(next time Italian Village) and definitely recommend this location to others."
9330,9330,"Asian skin on hyperpig¬≠mentation With a naturally higher hydration level in Asian skin, Asians show spots of hyperpig¬≠mentation, freckles and general unevenness of skin tone with age rather than wrinkles. Common skin disorders affecting many South Asians involving too much pigment include melasma and postinfl¬≠ammatory pigmentation. Melasma involves tan or brown patches mostly over the face. Sun exposure and skin irritation can worsen melasma, and this condition is often seen in pregnancy. And on Oiliness and Acne Due to Asian countries having a generally warm and humid climate, Asian skin naturally produces more oil, which leaves individuals of Asian descent more susceptible to acne outbreaks as opposed to Caucasians especially in dry weather like LAS VEGAS!! That‚Äôs why some Asians when they move here in Vegas they break out even though they never had acne before In most cases, acne outbreaks for Asians will be in the form of keloids or hardened bumps and reddening, which can lead to permanent scarring if they are not treated quickly and thoroughly.

Masai was on film earlier in the evening wearing a red pass. That pass gives arena access but not court access, which is very tightly restricted and requires a purple pass. Right after Finals games the police and arena security form a ring around the court to prevent people from rushing the court and turning it into a mob scene. Only purple passes get through, everyone else is turned around. Masai as a long time NBA exec absolutely knew this routine and absolutely knew what level of access he had."

2255,2255,long Read The human brain is a funny thing Certain memories can stick with us forever the birth of a child a car crash an election day But we only store some details the color of the hospital delivery room or the smell of the polling station while others fade such as the face of the nurse when that child was born or what we were wearing during that accident For Google CEO Sundar Pichai the day he watched AI rise out of a lab is one he will remember forever advertisement advertisement This was in a room with a small team and there were just a few of us he tells me An engineer named Jeff Dean a legendary programmer at Google who helped build its search engine had been working on a new project and wanted Pichai to have a look Anytime Jeff wants to update you on something you just get excited by it he says Pichai does not recall exactly which building he was in when Dean presented his work though odd details of that day have stuck with him He remembers standing rather than sitting and someone joking about an HR snafu that had designated the newly hired Geoffrey Hinton the Father of Deep Learning an AI researcher for four decades and later a Turing Award winner as an intern The future CEO of Google was an SVP at the time running Chrome and Apps and he had not been thinking about AI No one at Google was really not in a significant way Yes Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin had stated publicly years prior that artificial intelligence would transform the company The ideal search engine is smart Page told Online magazine in May It has to understand your query and it has to understand all the documents and that s clearly AI But at Google and elsewhere machine learning had been delivering meager results for decades despite grand promises Illustration Gabriel Silveira Now though powerful forces were stirring inside Google s servers For a little more than a year Dean Andrew Ng and their colleagues had been building a massive network of interconnected computers linked together in ways modeled on the human brain The team had engineered processors in computers which ¬≠combined were capable of making billion connections This was unprecedented for a computer system though still far from a human brain s capacity of more than trillion connections To test how this massive neural net processed data the engineers had run a deceptively simple experiment For three days straight they had fed the machine a diet of millions of random images from videos on YouTube which Google had acquired in They gave it no other instructions waiting to see what it would do if left on its own What they learned was that a computer brain bingeing on YouTube is not so different from a human s In a remote part of the computer s memory Dean and his peers discovered that it had spontaneously generated a blurry over¬≠pixelated image of one thing it had seen repeatedly over the course of hours a cat This was a machine teaching itself to think advertisement The day he watched this kind of intelligence emerge from Google s servers for the first time Pichai remembers feeling a shift in his thinking a sense of premonition This thing was going to scale up and maybe reveal the way the universe works he says This will be the most important thing we work on as humanity The rise of AI inside Google resembles a journey billions of us are on collectively hurtling into a digital future that few of us fully understand and that we can not opt out of One dominated in large part by Google Few other companies let alone governments on the planet have the ability or ambition to advance computerized thought Google operates more products with billion users than any other tech company on earth Android Chrome Drive Gmail Google Play Store Maps Photos Search and YouTube Unless you live in China if you have an internet connection you almost certainly rely on Google to augment some parts of your brain Shortly after Pichai took over as CEO in he set out to remake Google as an AI first company It already had several research oriented AI divisions including Google Brain and DeepMind which it acquired in and Pichai focused on turning all that intelligence about intelligence into new and better Google products Gmail s Smart Compose introduced in May is already suggesting more than billion characters in email drafts each week Google Translate can re create your own voice in a language you do not speak And Duplex Google s AI powered personal assistant can book appointments or reservations for you by phone using a voice that sounds so human the recipients of the calls were not aware it was a robot talking until the company was forced in the wake of public complaints to have Duplex identify itself Illustration Gabriel Silveira The full reach of Google s AI influence stretches far beyond the company s offerings Outside developers at startups and big corporations alike now use Google s AI tools to do everything from training smart satellites to monitoring changes to the earth s surface to rooting out abusive language on Twitter well it s trying There are now millions of devices using Google AI and this is just the beginning Google is on the verge of achieving what s known as quantum supremacy This new breed of computer will be able to crack complex equations a million or more times faster than regular ones We are about to enter the rocket age of computing Used for good artificial intelligence has the potential to help society It may find cures to deadly diseases Google execs say that its intelligent machines have demonstrated the ability to detect lung cancer a full year earlier than human doctors feed the hungry and even heal the climate A paper submitted to a Cornell University science journal in June by several leading AI researchers including ones affiliated with Google identified several ways machine learning can address climate change from accelerating the development of solar fuels to radically optimizing energy usage Used for ill AI has the potential to empower tyrants crush human rights and destroy democracy freedom and privacy The American Civil Liberties Union issued a report in June titled The Dawn of Robot Surveillance that warned how millions of surveillance cameras such as those sold by Google already installed across the United States could employ AI to enable government monitoring and control of citizens This is already happening in parts of China A lawsuit filed that same month accuses Google of using AI in hospitals to violate patients privacy advertisement Every powerful advance in human history has been used for both good and evil The printing press enabled the spread of Thomas Paine s Common Sense but also Adolf Hitler s fascist manifesto Mein Kampf With AI however there s an extra dimension to this predicament The printing press does not choose the type it sets AI when it achieves its full potential would be able to do just that Now is the time to ask questions Think about the kinds of thoughts you wish people had inventing fire starting the industrial revolution or developing atomic power says Greg Brockman cofounder of OpenAI a startup focused on building artificial general intelligence that received a billion investment from Microsoft in July Parties on both the political left and right argue that Google is too big and needs to be broken up Would a fragmented Google democratize AI Or as leaders at the company warn would it hand AI supremacy to the Chinese government which has stated its intention to take the lead President Xi Jinping has committed more than billion toward the goal of becoming the world s AI leader by Inside Google dueling factions are competing over the future of AI Thousands of employees are in revolt against their leaders trying to stop the tech they are building from being used to help governments spy or wage war How Google decides to develop and deploy its AI may very well determine whether the technology will ultimately help or harm humanity Once you build these AI systems they can be deployed across the whole world explains Reid Hoffman the LinkedIn cofounder and VC who s on the board of the Institute for Human Centered Artificial Intelligence at Stanford University That means anything their creators get right or wrong will have a correspondingly massive scale impact In the beginning the neural network is untrained says Jeff Dean one glorious spring evening in Mountain View California He is standing under a palm tree just outside the Shoreline Amphitheatre where Google is hosting a party to celebrate the opening day of I O its annual technology showcase This event is where Google reveals to developers and the rest of the world where it is heading next Dean in a mauve gray polo jeans sneakers and a backpack double strapped to his shoulders is one of the headliners It s like meeting Bono gushes one Korean software programmer who rushed over to take a selfie with Dean after he spoke at one event earlier in the day Jeff is God another tells me solemnly almost surprised that I do not already know this Around Google Dean is often compared to Chuck Norris the action star known for his kung fu moves and taking on multiple assailants at once advertisement Oh that looks good I will have one of those Dean says with a grin as a waiter stops by with a tray of vegan tapioca pudding cups Leaning against a tree he speaks about neural networks the way Laird Hamilton might describe surfing the Teahupo o break His eyes light up and his hands move in sweeping gestures Okay so here are the layers of the network he says grabbing the tree and using the grizzled trunk to explain how the neurons of a computer brain interconnect He looks intently at the tree as though he sees something hidden inside it Last year Pichai named Dean head of Google AI meaning that he s responsible for what the company will invest in and build a role he earned in part by scaling the YouTube neural net experiment into a new framework for training their machines to think on a massive scale That system started as an internal project called DistBelief which many teams including Android Maps and YouTube began using to make their products smarter But by the summer of as DistBelief grew inside Google Dean started to see that it had flaws It had not been designed to adapt to technological shifts such as the rise of GPUs the computer chips that process graphics or the emergence of speech as a highly complex data set Also DistBelief was not initially designed to be open source which limited its growth So he made a bold decision Build a new version that would be open to all In November Pichai introduced TensorFlow Dist¬≠Belief s successor one of his first big announcements as CEO It s impossible to overstate the significance of opening TensorFlow to developers outside of Google People could not wait to get their hands on it says Ian Bratt director of machine learning at Arm one of the world s largest designers of computer chips Today Twitter is using it to build bots to monitor conversations rank tweets and entice people to spend more time in their feed Airbus is training satellites to be able to examine nearly any part of the earth s surface within a few feet Students in New Delhi have transformed mobile devices into air quality monitors This past spring Google released early versions of TensorFlow which makes its AI even more accessible to inexperienced developers The ultimate goal is to make creating AI apps as easy as building a website TensorFlow has now been downloaded approximately million times Millions of devices cars drones satellites laptops phones use it to learn think reason and create An internal company document shows a chart tracking the usage of TensorFlow inside Google which by extension tracks machine learning projects It s up by since Tech insiders though point out that if TensorFlow is a gift to developers it may also be a Trojan horse I am worried that they are trying to be the gatekeepers of AI says an ex Google engineer who asked not to be named because his current work is dependent on access to Google s platform At present TensorFlow has just one main competitor Facebook s PyTorch which is popular among academics That gives Google a lot of control over the foundational layer of AI and could tie its availability to other Google imperatives Look at what Google s done with Android this person continues Last year European Union regulators levied a billion fine on the company for requiring electronics manufacturers to pre install Google apps on devices running its mobile operating system Google is appealing but it faces further investigations for its competitive practices in both Europe and India advertisement By helping AI proliferate Google has created demand for new tools and products that it can sell One example is Tensor Processing Units TPUs which are integrated circuits designed to accelerate applications using TensorFlow If developers need more power for their TensorFlow apps and they usually do they can pay Google for time and space using these chips running in Google data centers TensorFlow s success has won over the skeptics within Google s leadership Everybody knew that AI did not work Sergey Brin recalled to an interviewer at the World Economic Forum in People tried it they tried neural nets and none of it worked Even when Dean and his team started making progress Brin was dismissive Jeff Dean would periodically come up to me and say Look the computer made a picture of a cat and I said Okay that s very nice Jeff he said But he had to admit that AI was the most significant development in computing in my lifetime Stage of the Shoreline Amphitheatre fits people and every seat is taken It s the second day of I O and Jen Gennai Google s head of responsible innovation is hosting a session on Writing the Playbook for Fair and Ethical Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning She tells the crowd We have identified four areas that are our red lines technologies that we will not pursue We will not build or deploy weapons We will also not deploy technologies that we feel violate international human rights The company also pledges to eschew technologies that cause overall harm and gather or use information for surveillance violating internationally accepted norms She and two other Google executives go on to explain how the company now incorporates its AI principles into everything it builds and that Google has a comprehensive plan for tackling everything from rooting out biases in its algorithms to forecasting the unintended consequences of AI After the talk a small group of developers from different companies mingles dissatisfied I do not feel like we got enough observes one an employee of a large international corporation that uses TensorFlow and frequently partners with Google They are telling us Do not worry about it We got this We all know they do not got this These developers have every right to be skeptical Google s rhetoric has often contrasted with its actions but the stakes are higher with artificial intelligence Gizmodo was first to report in March that the company had a Pentagon contract for AI drone strike technology dubbed Project Maven After Google employees protested for three months Pichai announced that the contract would not be renewed Shortly thereafter another project came to light Dragonfly a search engine for Chinese users designed to be as powerful and ubiquitous as the one reportedly used for of U S searches except that it would also comply with China s censorship rules which ban content on some topics related to human rights democracy freedom of speech and civil disobedience Dragonfly would also link users phone numbers to their searches After employees protested for another four months and activists attempted to enlist Amnesty International and Google shareholders in the fight Google backed down saying it would not launch the search engine Illustration Gabriel Silveira During that turmoil a Google engineer confronted Dean directly about whether the company would continue working with oppressive regimes We need to know What are the red lines the engineer tells me echoing Google s own verbiage I was pushing for What are things you would never do I never got clarification The employee quit in protest advertisement When asked today about the dark side of AI the amiable Dean turns serious People in my organization were very outspoken about what we should be doing with the Department of Defense he says referring to their work on Maven Dean invokes Google s list of AI applications that it will not pursue One of them is work on autonomous weapons That to me is something I do not want to work on or have anything to do with he says looking me straight in the eyes Amid the initial Project Maven controversy The Intercept and The New York Times published emails that revealed Google s internal concerns about how the extent of its AI ambitions might be received I do not know what would happen if the media starts picking up a theme that Google is secretly building AI weapons Fei Fei Li then Google Cloud s chief AI scientist and one of the authors of Google s AI principles told colleagues in one of them Avoid at ALL COSTS any mention or implication of AI Weaponized AI is probably one of the most sensitized topics of AI if not THE most This is red meat to the media to find all the ways to damage Google She also suggested that the company plant some positive PR stories about Google s democratization of AI and something described as humanistic AI I d be super careful to protect these very positive images she wrote Li declined to be interviewed for this story She has since left the company to co lead Stanford s Human Centered AI Institute These AI protests have created an ongoing PR crisis In March the company announced an Advanced Technology External Advisory Council colloquially known as its AI ethics board but it fell apart just over a week later when thousands of Google employees protested its makeup The board had included a drone company CEO and the president of the right wing Heritage Foundation who had made public statements that were transphobic and denied climate change Pichai himself has stepped in several times Last November he wrote to employees acknowledging Google s missteps We recognize that we have not always gotten everything right in the past and we are sincerely sorry for that he said It s clear we need to make some changes But controversy continues to dog Google on how it deploys technology In August an employee organization called Googlers for Human Rights released a public petition with more than signatures asking the company not to offer any tech to Customs and Border Protection Immigration and Customs Enforcement or the Office of Refugee Resettlement A representative for Google responds that the company supports employee activism When I ask Pichai about how Google s AI principles influence his own work he connects it to another corporate priority assuaging concerns about what Google does with all the user data it possesses What I am pushing the teams on is around AI and privacy he says It s a bit counterintuitive but I think AI gives us a chance to enhance privacy Last spring he discussed efforts within Google to use machine learning to protect data on a smartphone from being accessed by anyone other than its owner He says fears about the dangers of AI are overblown It s important for people to understand what not to worry about too which is it s really early and we do have time he explains Pichai hopes that Google can quell any disquiet over AI s dangers by showcasing its virtue Under an initiative dubbed AI for Social Good Google is deploying its machine learning to solve what it describes as the world s greatest social humanitarian and environmental problems There are teams harnessing AI to forecast floods track whales diagnose cancer and detect illegal mining and logging At I O one young entrepreneur from Uganda invited by Google spoke of using TensorFlow to track army worms across Africa a cause of famine throughout the continent Google s AI Impact Challenge launched in offers million in grants to charities and startups applying AI to causes such as saving rain forests and fighting fires advertisement The company has also pulled back on two controversial initiatives amid the AI debate Last December Google shelved its facial recognition software even as rival Amazon moved forward with its own version despite its own employee protests and charges that it enables law enforcement to racially profile citizens One insider estimates that the move could cost Google billions in revenue The company also withdrew from bidding on a billion project to provide cloud computing to the Pentagon citing ethical concerns Amazon and Microsoft are still in the running When asked how Google determines whether a project is good or bad for society Pichai cites something called the lip reading project A team of engineers had an idea to use AI in cameras to read lips The intention was to enable communication for nonverbal people However some raised concerns about unintended consequences Could bad actors use it for surveillance through say street cameras The engineers tested it on street cams CCTV and other public cameras and determined that the AI needs to be close up to work Google published a paper detailing the effort confident that for now it can be used safely It s a sunny afternoon in Santa Barbara California but the thermometer inside Google s lab reads millikelvin about th of a kelvin above absolute zero This is one of the coldest places in the universe Erik Lucero a research scientist working in the lab tells me Inside of this he says pointing to a shiny metal container is colder than space The vessel is the size and shape of an oil drum made of copper and plated with real gold Thick wires made out of niobium ¬≠titanium emerge from the top octopus ¬≠like carrying control and measurement signals to and from its processor This barrel encases one of the most fragile and potentially most powerful machines on earth a quantum computer If all goes as planned it will turbocharge the capabilities of artificial intelligence in ways that may well reshape how we think about the universe and humanity s place in it The dream of quantum computing has been around since the s when Richard Feynman an original member of the Manhattan Project which built the atomic bomb began theorizing ways to unlock computing power by adapting the quantum mechanics used to create nuclear science Today our computers run on bits of information that equal either zero or one in value they have to calculate outcomes probabilities and equations step by step serially exhausting every option before arriving at an answer Quantum computers by contrast create qubits where zeros and ones can exist simultaneously This allows qubits to process certain kinds of information far faster How much faster One widely cited example is that a qubit computer could perform as many simultaneous calculations as there are atoms in the universe Those are actually qubits Lucero says directing me to look under a microscope where I see some fuzzy black Xs There are of them This is the smaller batch Elsewhere in the lab Google has created qubits For now they can only survive for microseconds and conditions have to be colder than outer space advertisement In order to create a commercially viable quantum computer Google will need to produce enough qubits and keep them stable and error free long enough to be able to make any major computing breakthroughs Other labs are competing here too but Google has assembled some of the world s foremost experts to find ways to create an environment in which qubits can survive and thrive It s moving faster toward this goal than anyone expected Last December Google tested its best quantum processor against a regular laptop and the laptop won A few weeks later after some adjustments to the processor it beat the laptop but still lagged behind a desktop computer In February the quantum computer outmatched every other computer in the lab Hartmut Neven who leads Google s quantum team presented the lab s advances during Google s Quantum Spring Symposium in May describing the increases in processing power as double exponential a mind ¬≠bending equation that looks like this Within computer science circles this growth rate for quantum computing has been dubbed Neven s law a nod to Moore s law which posits that classical computing advances by doubling the number of transistors that can fit on a chip every months Now Google s team is honing in on the major milestone known as quantum supremacy It will still be years before Google s quantum computer reaches its full potential But in the lab the anticipation of this moment is palpable There are currently problems that humanity will not be able to solve without a quantum computer Lucero says standing next to the machine poised to achieve this feat The whole idea that you are jumping into a new potential for humankind that s exciting The room hums rhythmically the sound of qubits hatching What will it mean for humanity when computers can think and calculate at exponentially faster speeds and on parallel planes This emerging science may be able to explain the deepest mysteries of the universe dark matter black holes the human brain It s the Hello World moment Lucero says referring to the introduction of Macintosh the computer that launched a new era for a generation of coders As Google opens the door to this new cosmos we all need to get ready for what s on the other side A version of this article appeared in the October issue of Fast Company magazine

13078,13078,Hi All well Crazy times eh I have been slowly chipping away at this project The turbine housing and cast steel adapter has been port matched to aid flow this was a fun job seriously It was all done with a die grinder and i am pretty sure i have kg worth of metal shavings in my hair right now Before During After Blue paint for added effect It will be interesting to see if the leading edge of the bridged section erodes away through thermal corrosion i have heard that this can be an issue not that i particularly care I also thought it was a good idea to sand down the combustion chamber flange faces Even though i was impressed with how little the flanges warped during the welding process i thought it was still a good idea to sand away a few of the high points to give the still to come copper gasket a chance Currently at the profile cutter s is the supporting sheet metal that i have designed to keep this assembly under control Heat soak into surrounding structures may becomes an issue with this design due to a direct thermal pathway between the bottom combustor flange and the supporting structure however i guess we will see One last thing worth mentioning I have been trying to think of a simple way to position and feed an oil spray nozzle inside the combustion chamber whilst also allowing for LPG to be injected for startup I came up with a design and sent it out for a quote at a local machining shop Since selling my liver is not an option i am now looking for other ideas that i could build myself Has anyone developed a modular system to allow oil injection and an LPG feed for startup

5670,5670,"Hello! First of all, idk where to post this because I have no idea what this may be connected to so sorry in advance. So my problem is that a couple days ago I was drawing on my drawing monitor, everything worked nice and smooth, then I took a break to play a game and watch some vids, and when I resumed drawing, the lines started to come out jagged (again, worked perfectly before, it's not default jitter some tablets have). Example Imgur: The magic of the Internet Brown lines are done on my drawing monitor. Deinstalled the drivers, installed old tablet - same thing happening (black lines). Purple ones are from sensitivity check of the driver app, so it's not just the program being buggy either. Sensitivity works for both tablets. As far as I can tell, mouse kind of behaves the same way (hard to tell but lines still should look smooth instead of looking like 8bit art piece). The cursor should normally smoothly follow the pen, instead it kind of jumps or snaps to a new position. This is happening in both of my windows accounts. I didn't install anything new recently, malware bytes doesn't detect anything. I booted the system in ""diagnostic startup"" to see if maybe something is interferring, still the same thing. Disconnected the touchpad and mouse and tried the pen and mouse in different usb ports (I have 2 separate pairs with different drivers) still behaves the same. If anyone knows of ANY things that may affect the cursor\input\whatever please lay them on me.. PS It's impossible to work like this, it's been 2 days and all I find in google are tablet driver problems, jitter tests and ""did you try to not touch the touchpad when you type"""

4146,4146,If you d rather listen to me narrate this same post with some pictures for visual aids and all that here s a minute video Otherwise I have written up a full transcript here fair warning this is gonna be VERY long for all of you at work or who can not listen to audio or whatever Skip past the following parentheses for the transcript to begin Some of you may recognize the video from a couple days ago when I posted it A few of you immediately made me aware of some big flaws in my logic in one of my early answers which pretty much destroyed my credibility from the beginning So I took the post and video down and reworked a bunch of it Some questions have entirely different better answers now I replaced a segment of the intro narration with another segment where I more clearly define what is and is not a plot hole so we can all be on the same page and made a few other minor tweaks There s nothing like putting minutes of your opinions logic out there for a big community to see and watching s of brains rightly pick it apart I mean that in the best way possible It s a pretty beautiful process haha I d like to think the video and therefore this post is better for it So thank you to those who commented a few nights ago Anything from here on out in parentheses is not discussed in the video but I feel I can explore some additional thoughts here for those that want to read them Intro There s been a lot of really interesting and valid criticisms of The Last Jedi that I have been seeing around but also a lot of really strange questions plot holes being parroted around masked as criticism And that s what I take issue with This is in response to a video made by a fairly big YouTuber called Plot Hole Questions For Star Wars The Last Jedi YTer is Levelcap fyi And what I am going to do is use some very simple abilities that we all have to infer to critically think and to read between the lines and occasionally do some research And we are gonna see how many of these questions we can answer without the movie having to spoon feed us every little detail Now it seems to some people the definition of a plot hole has broadened so much that it now includes questions like this I believe they are wrong So for the sake of this post let us agree on a definition I really like the urban dictionary definition the best there s surprisingly few actual definitions of the term but the ones that exist pretty much say the same thing This one just puts it most succinctly to me In a piece of fiction a Plot Hole is a completely implausible occurrence or series of events that contradicts logic or previously established events in the story Includes things such as unlikely behaviour or actions of characters illogical or impossible events events happening for no apparent reason or statements events that contradict earlier events in the storyline A Plot Hole is NOT a simple omission of information or unanswered question These can only be considered a Plot Hole if said omission has no plausible explanation AND is essential information to the overall story s outcome Plot Hole Something that goes against logic or the previous events in the fiction Not a Plot Hole A small unexplained event in the story ACTUAL Plot Hole In Batman Begins a microwave emitter is used to vaporize the water in Gotham to release a psychedelic drug that the water has been laced with However the microwaves would in all actuality cause all of the water molecules in every human body to boil and kill everyone very painfully But this does not happen in the movie NOT a Plot Hole In The Dark Knight Rises not explaining how Bruce Wayne manages to get back onto the Island of Gotham after it has been cut off from the rest of the world You can reasonably infer that because he is Batman he can manage to get himself back onto the island and the movie does not need to show this The key element I am using for this post is that an unanswered question can only be considered a plot hole if the omission has no reasonable explanation Someone commented on my previous video that going by this logic then plot holes would not exist because then you could say the characters just ate a magical jelly bean off screen that allows them to resolve whatever question you may have This is categorically untrue because this would be a very unreasonable explanation Granted I did not clearly go over this definition of a plot hole in my previous video so their point was more valid Several times throughout this post I am not going to know the correct canon answer and I will begin with something like I do not know but here s my best explanation I do not claim to be all knowing when it comes to this movie or Star Wars in general but I am still refuting that the question is a plot hole by offering up a reasonable explanation One that makes sense within both Star Wars canon and the storyline of this movie particularly So with that being said I am about to begin answering these questions point by point in the order that they appear in levelcap s video I condensed a few of them down because he asks the same question twice or they are similar enough that they could be answered with the same explanation so the end total of questions will not be but Without farther ado let us get going Obviously there will be spoilers ahead MY REFUTATIONS Why did the First Order fighters pull back from attacking the Resistance fleet In the movie Hux calls Kylo Ren and his wingmen off of the Resistance fleet because they were out of range of the FO fleet who could not cover them any longer very quickly Kylo Ren s wingmen are blown up to show this One might imagine that the First Order did not want to needlessly risk resources seeing as how the Resistance was in such a terrible spot and their fate was looking inevitable Another factor is that while Kylo did blow up the launch bay of the main Resistance ship some of the other ships did still have launch bays of their own and could scramble fighters if the FO did send their own after the Resistance fleet and would likely result in heavy losses The win win scenario for the FO was that waiting hours for the Resistance s fuel to run out means they wipe out the Resistance AND get to keep many of their Ties alive Why are Resistance ships able to outrun First Order ships Take your pick Either the Resistance ships have faster or more efficient engines than the FO ships or they have to burn more fuel in order to keep distance from the FO fleet Throughout the movie there is dialogue from both the FO and Resistance explaining they are able to keep a safe distance but they just will not be able to sustain it Do they really need to explain why exactly Why did the Resistance ships slow down when they run out of fuel Would not Newton s First Law Apply here Alright this one s pretty stupid So Star Wars has a loooong history of not obeying the laws of physics as you may know But as long as we are using Newton s First Law I will spell this one out It actually sorta works here If one space ship is chasing another ship and both are accelerating equally and everything else is equal and the lead ships stops accelerating ie runs out of fuel mind you just because it stops accelerating does not mean it is slowing down then the chasing ship as long as it is still accelerating will catch up to and overtake the lead ship This might appear as if the lead ship is slowing down though Relativity There s a little animation in my video to help illustrate this None of the ships in it ever slow down per se but one does stop accelerating and is therefore overtaken by the still accelerating chasing empire fleet just like in the movie Why can not Hux have some of his destroyers hyperjump in front of the Resistance fleet to block them off This is a really good question and one that I have been seeing around a lot But I think there s a good explanation And it has to do with hyperlanes Throughout the galaxy of Star Wars there are pre established hyperlanes that ships use when hyperjumping to other locations These are sure to be safe trails to travel on It s incredibly risky to make a jump without a hyperlane This is why it s very important for the galaxy geopolitically when a new lane is discovered or explored because big military fleets typically only use these to make advances So what do we know about D Qar and Crait They are both in the Outer Rim of the galaxy and basically have far fewer hyperlanes than in the core populated places of the galaxy Crait is even totally unmapped so I think we can reasonably infer there are not ANY established or widely known hyperlanes nearby also worth noting that hyperlanes are not omnidirectional Therefore the First Order probably deems it too risky to make a micro jump like the one described in the question just to speed up what they thought to be inevitable Now should the movie have included some throwaway lines of dialogue describing this That s for you to decide but I really do not think so It d basically be totally unnecessary exposition just to address a question that of people will not even think to ask But there s your answer for you crazy percenters Other factors could include fuel usage We clearly hear that making a jump takes a large amount of fuel in the movie So if the First Order captains wanted to pull a maneuver like this they better have perfect calculations or they might wind up out of the chase altogether And Also to address any related questions like The Resistance jumped in the beginning of the movie so would not that mean they used a hyperlane First to that I would say not necessarily I do not think they would be that worried about making a blind jump seeing as how they are about to be wiped out anyway The FO would only be following their jumps because of their tracker And second the Resistance FO could have very well used a hyperlane to jump from D Qar to close ish to Crait which then probably did not have any other hyperlanes nearby as they headed to Crait Why do not blasters affect shields at long range I have no idea what this question is in reference to I have seen the movie times and still do not Why can shields stop capital ship weapons but fighters can pass straight through We already have examples of shields behaving similarly to this For example in the Battle of Naboo when the bubble shields block blaster fire but let the battle droids through them The Shields of the Raddus the Resistance flagship appear to behave similarly Also it would be really inconvenient for a ship to have to lower its shields every time it sent out in a fighter from its launch bay So I think ship shields have always behaved like this if I am not mistaken When did spaceship shields become bubbles Check out the last answer But also there are different types of shields in the Star Wars universe You do not think there might be different manufactures brands of shields all of which probably behave a little differently from each other Or is a universe as large as Star Wars only allowed to show you one type of shield Thermal shields and deflector shields are two different types just to name a few Why did the Resistance transports get blown up so easily when flying to Crait Could not they have tried evasive maneuvers Poe was able to dodge like dreadnought turrets earlier Hmmm Could it be that transports might handle a little differently than fighters especially one piloted by Poe Those escape transports are probably a liiiittle less nimble than fighters and are therefore much easier targets too Why did not Holdo try to block the incoming fire on the transports Holdo did not really have all that much time to come up with something once she saw the transports getting blasted and what she did come up with was pretty damn effective To give a more direct answer I think this would be easier said than done given how the artillery shots from the Supremacy Snoke s ship traveled in an arch which might just arch themselves over the Raddus even if she did line herself up perfectly I would also say that if she were to only block the incoming fire the Resistance probably would not have ever made it off of Crait When she did her Kamikaze run do not worry we will get there too she crippled the FO forces that could then assault the base and destroyed their ability to keep up the chase Why did the FO only find out about the transports when DJ told them There actually are a couple throw away lines that give us enough to fill in the details As the transports are leaving the Raddus a Resistance crew member aboard a transport says we are cloaked and should not show up on their scopes I take this to mean that these scopes might behave somewhat similarly to submarine sonar where you kind of have to know exactly what you are looking listening for on the radar to see what you are looking for This is backed up by a FO officer telling Hux that they ran a decloaking scan and were then able to identify the transports Why did Finn Rose tell DJ about the plan They did not But you clearly see him perk up once he overhears them get word of the plan from Poe or whoever fills them in on it as they are approaching the Supremacy Why did not Holdo have all her ships jump away in different directions I am not entirely sure but it probably has something to do with the plan to hide out on Crait If it had worked they would have all been safe Also safety in numbers and all that stuff How come ships can hyperjump in out of the Resistance fleet without the FO doing anything Again I am not totally sure They could have noticed Poe and Rose s single escape shuttle leave and decided not to chase it Or they did not notice it at all also this is the only time it s done without explanation When Finn Rose and DJ jump back in DJ cloaks their approach and when the Falcon jumps in it immediately jumps back out once it releases Rey in her escape pod Why do the bombers fly so close together if they blow up so big Check out bombing operations in WW2 Turreted bombers pretty much exactly like the ones in the movie stayed in close formation as a means of defense against fighters Any fighter that wanted to attack a bomber had to expose himself to several different fields of fire from several different bomber turrets Any bomber on its own was an easy kill for any fighter pilot Why were the bombs operated by some guy with a remote This is an infinitely retarded question Again look at any bomber in history and you will find the bombs were operated by a guy with some kind of remote for a more direct answer What else would they use The resistance is known to have to scrape together whatever resources they can get their hands on so those bombers probably are not state of the art technology Many of the resistance ships tech are fairly low tech we see that in both movies I would also highly doubt that s the only way to release the bombs it s just the one she as the tail gunner if I remember correctly was closest to good chance it was a backup manual bomb release maybe the visual dictionary or cross sections book explains better The pilot or other crewmembers might have controls too but they were incapacitated Also and most importantly how exactly do the controls being an analog control vs a fancy computer screen or whatever change any of the outcome of the scene It s a really dumb thing to even bring up in the first place Why do the bombs fall down in space Bombs do not technically drop in microgravity but are impelled from their racks by sequenced electromagnetic plates in the clip The bombs are then drawn magnetically to their unfortunate targets From TLJ visual dictionary Why did not the bombers just release their bombers from farther away I would assume it probably has something to do with the electromagnets discussed in the last answer needed to be within a certain range to activate Why does not the dreadnought fly away when it sees the bombers coming Wow this would have been a really valuable tactic in say the Battle of Midway If only the Japanese Captains just sailed away when they saw the American bombers coming I keep bringing up WW2 naval and aerial combat because Star Wars has always taken a huge inspiration from that and if you ask Why not just hyperjump away well to that I d ask how long does it take to spool up a hyperdrive in that big of a ship If we are going off of when Holdo does her kamikaze maneuver it takes the Raddus a smaller ship than the dreadnought a good seconds depending how you interpret the timeline of that scene Why does not the First Order release fighters immediately when coming out of hyperspace and into a battle My favorite character in the movie the dreadnought captain RIP We hardly knew ye seems to share this exact same sentiment when he exclaims We should have released fighters FIVE BLOODY MINUTES AGO which kind of implies they were off to a sloppy start to their attack also remember this is probably many of these captains very first major space battle experience The dreadnought captain was older and probably had a lot more experience with these things which is why he was so pissed in the first place Why did the First Order think Poe was just a messenger ship Why not blow him up immediately They were probably just curious about what he d have to say with him not being considered much of a threat you can hear this in the way Hux laughs as he says A single fighter approaches We also know that one of the major flaws of both the Empire and now apparently the FO too is arrogance Poe is trying to exploit this here by buying as much time as he can Why can Holdo use Hyperspace travel as a weapon and why has not this been done previously Especially against the deathstar etc This one s making lots of people angry But there s a couple theories I have seen that I really like They would very neatly explain why this was only a viable tactic in this particular scenario The simplest one is taken directly from some dialogue in The Force Awakens when Han Chewy and Finn are hyperjumping into Starkiller Base Han says this when asked how they are getting in Their shields have a fractional refresh rate Keeps anything traveling slower than lightspeed from getting through I can totally buy that the First Order uses these same shields on their big ships too He does not specify in the dialogue that only Starkiller Base has this kind of shield when he says their shields which implies he knows something about First Order shields in general The other less likely but completely awesome theory is basically this Since the Supremacy can track ships through hyperspace and hyperspace is known to basically be another dimension The tracker must physically exist in both dimensions at once and therefore when Holdo kamikazes the Supremacy she is slamming into the unshielded unprotected tracker in the hyperspace dimension causing the insanity we saw in the movie Hopefully I did that theory justice Because I think it s cool as hell Thanks u neutronknows for this one Why build such a big ship if something so small can destroy it There s actually precedent for this in previous Star Wars movies as well as in real life history Regarding Star Wars the Executor the super stardestroyer is taken out by a single A wing pilot when he careens into its bridge And then in real life there are tons of examples of single small planes doing enormous damage to huge ships with torpedoes or bombs or even by crashing into them Point being that these huge ships need to be protected be cause their utility far outweighs their fragility Why does Poe have to land aboard the Raddus before it jumps to hyperspace Do not X Wings have hyperdrives Yes X Wings do have hyperdrives but they may not be comparable to the ones on the bigger ships So it s probably so they can stay together Another possibility is in the beginning of The Last Jedi Poe s X Wing is outfitted with an additional booster engine on the back This might have required removing his hyperdrive Maybe the cross sections book will explain better How did Finn Rose escape the Supremacy if Ties were chasing their shuttle the whole time There s actually nothing to suggest ties were chasing them the whole time We see several shots of them flying away freely and only their landing approach is when they are chased by ties It also does not appear that the ties are even shooting at them until they almost reach the door so the ties were probably racing to catch up to them How did Rey get from the Supremacy back to the Millennium Falcon In the scene where Hux finds Snoke dead and Kylo unconsious Hux tells Kylo that she took Snoke s personal shuttle How do Finn Rose know how to fly speeders Is not Rose just a mechanic There are many examples throughout Star Wars of families even poor families owning some type of speeder It seems to be a common enough skill akin to driving a car We also see Finn struggling to keep his speeder up until Rose has to tell him to drop the mono ski Why does not Finn melt in the beam but parts of his speeder does It looks like he would have melted if he d stayed in the beam much longer I am sure it did not feel good while he was in it but someone operating on adrenaline can tolerate some crazy stuff upon watching the movie a third time I kept a close eye on this scene and never saw anything in his cockpit melt Just the guns on the outside So I think we can conclusively say the cockpit was shielding him from the bulk of the heat Why does Rose think crashing into Finn will save him Did she calculate the impact speeds exactly so they both would not die No I really do not think she calculated the impact speeds But I bet her thought process went something like this Finn has a chance of dying if I let him fly into that cannon but less than if I crash him out of the way So I will go with that option Related Bonus Question How was Rose able to catch up to Finn when she clearly turned off from the attack run earlier Finn s speeder was being significantly slowed down by flying directly into the beam To the point where even if he had collided with the cannon it probably would not have done anything another reason Rose saved him How was Finn able to drag Rose to safety Honestly this one is probably lazy writing But if you want me to make a stretch on the Battlefront map of Crait there are all kinds of small caves and trenches out there that he may have used to hide and move closer to the door But either way it s a pretty ridiculous feat Why do Tie Fighters keep chasing the Falcon into tight spaces Because Kylo literally told all of his Ties to go kill the Falcon there and they did not want to let it escape How was the Falcon able to land and save the Rebels safely Would not there be Ties patrolling around Again because Kylo told all of his Ties to go kill the Falcon The First Order probably did not have access to all the fighters they may have wanted after Holdo crippled the entire fleet That s probably why there are not as many Ties as you would have thought Thinking a little bit about what you just watched a few seconds ago might help with answering some of these questions before you call them plot holes Did the First Order leave the planet Crait once they saw the Resistance was gone Uhhh probably they did yeah But I seriously doubt the First Order fleet s capability to continue the chase at that point It really seems to me that information just enters your brain and gets spat out completely unprocessed So maybe you do need to have everything spoon fed to you Either that or you are intentionally artificially inflating how many plot holes you think are in this movie If the entire Resistance can fit aboard the Millennium Falcon now is it even a Resistance any more Well we are gonna have to wait until the next movie comes out to find out Buuut I am gonna go out on a limb and say Yes How are they so confident people will sign up for the Resistance now I think you could answer this by asking another question That is How many people in the galaxy do you think want to live under the rule of the First Order Also after Luke did what he did he provided the new spark of hope that s getting people fired up to join We see this by the story of him facing down the entire First Order with his lazer sword being told by the kids on Canto Bight How is Finn so good at fighting Wasn t he just promoted from a janitor Without doing a whole deep dive on Finn s time with the First Order here it is in a nutshell Finn was regarded as one of the best of his corpse He worked directly under Phasma too And many soldiers are assigned various upkeep duties while they are deployed and not fighting Why does Phasma suck at fighting She does not She pretty clearly beats Finn here and would have won if it were not for him falling onto a rising elevator perfectly and then hitting her while she was surprised How come Phasma s armor can block blaster fire but no one else s can Should not all the troopers have that armor Phasma s armor is made from chromium The same stuff the coated the Royal Naboo yachts that we see Amidala aboard in the prequels It s very rare Why did Finn Rose park their ship on the beach Again I am not entirely sure but a little inference here does not hurt They probably did not want to have to register in a parking system and risk being identified hoping instead no one would notice before they left This obviously did not work out Why does BB have a casino coin shooter I do not think the only purpose of that is to shoot coins But you really got me there Upon looking at TFA visual dictionary it explains BB has a bunch of different modules he can swap in and out of Why does not the Resistance have their own codebreaker guy Right Seeing as how they apparently grow on trees The resistance is shown to have only about people in the fleet at the beginning of The Last Jedi I am sure they would love to have their very own codebreaker among their ranks Why does Maz take a phone call in the middle of a firefight Because Maz is one kooky girl seriously though I do not know this scene felt like what you would see right before you get on the Star Tours ride Why are there only a few hundred people in the Resistance Because the rest of the New Republic did not view the First Order as a threat So only Leia and her loyal followers were left as the watchdogs against them The New Republic was also nearly entirely demilitarized prior to TFA Granted neither movie of the sequels does a very good job at establishing any of this But it is discussed in the books Why is Poe so quickly forgiven for disobeying orders and even mutiny The Resistance could not exactly afford to lock up one of their most influential heroes at that point They had more pressing matters and we clearly see Holdo kind of understand why he did what he did Her and Leia both knew at the end he was trying to do the right thing based off what he knew at the time Why does Holdo dress like she s going to an Arcade Fire concert It clearly causes people to undermine her authority First because Holdo is a senator And second I really do not think THAT S what caused Poe to undermine her Why did not Holdo just tell Poe about the plan to escape to Crait Poe was just demoted and had displayed serious issues with authority and leadership This is her very first impression of him I think if you look at it from her perspective it makes way more sense It s also probable that Holdo was about to tell Poe right when he noticed the transports being fueled up and freaked out kicking things and calling her a coward and traitor in front of the crew Not exactly what the crew needs to hear at that point Going off the info she had at the time most commanders in this situation would kick Poe off the bridge or worse Why did we get a topless Kylo Ren scene I mean Kylo is pretty hot Just be thankful it did not happen while one of them was on the toilet For real though I just read an article that says it was basically a fun way to show the audience how much they could see of each other Why can ghost Yoda control lightning I do not know but I do actually have a theory I think it might have to do with how force rich the area is Especially since it was the first Jedi Temple The island seems to be very powerful with the Force This will be an interesting thing to theorize about though and I am actually kind of happy they did not answer this What s the deal with Chewy s crazy arch He goes from hating cable chewing minocks to loving porgs Who even is Chewy any more Right Because minocks are totally equivalent to porgs Minocks are not disgusting at all Would Chewy have had the same dilemma if he were to eat a minock as others watched I really do not Minocks are really gross This question was really dumb How can Luke project himself to another location across the galaxy Have Jedi always known about this power That was pretty crazy right Again we do not exactly know But it s really awesome and seems like it requires an absurd mastery of the force in order to do that But if you really take issue with any new force abilities being explored then you probably should not be watching any of the newer movies What happened to Luke s green lightsaber And why did not he just use that one in his projection instead of the blue one that just got broken in half No idea what happened to Luke s green lightsaber But it could also have something to do with that being what he used in his greatest moment of shame So he wanted to appear to the Resistance as his best self It s also worth noting that Luke may not have known about the status of his blue saber going into that scene But there s also a chance that he did it in order to troll Kylo even more once he finally realized he was fighting nothing all along It s a great way to display the downsides of fighting with so much literal blind hatred How did Maz get Luke s blue lightsaber This question should go to JJ Abrams I really do not think the answer to this is all that important to the story of these sequel movies But maybe it will be answered in episode Who was Snoke and what was his deal I will let Rian Johnson take this one and then add a little bit to his answer afterwards This is from a really interesting IGN article where he explains a little about his thought process in this scene I highly recommend reading it if you want to know more It s not about where he come s from It s not about his backstory He is the guy behind the guy and I think he plays out his part in this movie as is appropriate What Rian s basically saying here is that his backstory does not matter to the story going forward Snoke served a purpose and fulfilled it I am sure at some point we will get a proper backstory on Snoke But I am totally in agreement with Rian here I think Snoke was one of the weaker characters of the last movie and I am kind of glad to see him gone And I know that Snoke s sudden death is one of those huge things that some fans are really upset about And it deserves it s own video post just on that and I have seen a few good ones here and there already You do not have to like the answer That answer being that it does not matter But it certainly is not a plot hole Why can Snoke detect every thought Kylo is having but he can not sense he s about to get killed by him The movie does a really nice job at visually addressing this Snoke wasn t exactly reading Kylo s direct thoughts here But reading his lack of conflict Snoke sensed total darkness in Kylo and took that to mean that surely he was about to kill Rey why Snoke laughed at the notion of Rey turning him to the light He also sensed Kylo s physical actions with the lightsaber that he was masking with the force He totally caught Snoke off guard here If it s so easy to manipulate lightsabers from afar would not Jedi stop carrying them for fear of someone else activating theirs I did not get the impression this was easy to do It probably takes a ton of dexterity and fine control over the force to be able to pull this off as well as an unsuspecting victim Why is Rey even better at fighting in this movie To me the answer is still the same as in the last movie Rey has grown up fighting for herself and already has a pretty good understanding of melee fighting mechanics She benefited especially in her TLJ fight by having Kylo Ren back her up Once they got separated she struggled She only won by using a cheeky move from a bind I think Kylo shows her up big time here He handles praetorian guards at once during the fight Her sudden and seemingly exponential growth in the force might also help with her lightsaber control too Why do they think Snoke is dead Could not he just get robot legs like Darth Maul in Clone Wars I d say the closeup of his lifeless body with eyes rolled back and tongue out to be pretty conclusive BUT People already have their theories out that he somehow survived so who knows Why is the slave kid able to move things with the force already Does not that take tons of training to accomplish His midichlorians are off the charts But seriously he might just be a savant with the force He only moved a broom about inches so let us not freak out about this Why did Luke leave a map to himself if he did not want to be found Luke never made a map to himself or to the island Han says that it was people that knew him best that thought he went to the first Jedi Temple It was Lor San Tekka that helped research making a map to the first temple where they thought he MIGHT be CONCLUSION So there s all of the questions answered and holy hell that was exhausting typing all of this out I did want to put some closing thoughts to wrap up this post As someone who actually totally adores this movie I wanted to address some of the more ridiculous criticisms I have been seeing around with this post and show why they are actually pretty much invalid for the most part And I thought Levelcap s video would be a good place to start doing that I know this is not all of the plot holes or questions out there Most of these are not even plot hole type questions they are just questions If you are adamant about saying these are plot holes I could guarantee you could make a similar list as long as this one or longer about each previous Star Wars movie There s a lot of unanswered questions in these movies that are answered by looking deeper into the lore or the visual dictionaries and wikis I have been mentioning The movie should not have to answer most questions like these They are not related to the plot and do not move anything forward I really do not think plot holes were much of a negative factor in this movie at all At least any more so than any other Star Wars movie So let us get to the substance of our criticisms Why did not you like how they handled Luke or Snoke s death Or why was the movie poorly structured I think that kind of thing is where the substance of criticism is for this movie even if I disagree with a lot of it but that s where the criticism has the most value That s what I wanted the point of this post to be Just clearing up some misconceptions so we can get to the good discussions For those of you that have read this whole thing there is something wrong with you and especially me for making this But thank you so much I d love to hear your guys thoughts on this kind of stuff TLDR Is it even possible to make a TLDR for this kind of post haha I do not know but I will try Basically most of the plot holes people have been throwing around are not actually plot holes until next time and happy squatch00

7754,7754,They send you down to war When you ask them How much should we give The only answer is More more more CCR Fortunate Son Markets What s become the norm for the stock market a bounce today occurred on virtually no news I wish I could provide more color around why stocks act the way they do right now but it should be evident to anyone watching that stocks are not a reflection of economic activity They are not forward looking instruments or whatever BS line you are being fed on TV They are video game and you are not given the cheat codes Also it s good time to revisit what we mean when we talk about the markets The largest companies Microsoft Apple Amazon Alphabet Google and Facebook carry the same weight as the smallest companies in the S P Also I have tried to talk about relative value of stocks before The value that you get for a stock is it s price divided by earnings For the whole market it s the market price divided by total earnings Slowly earnings forecasts are starting to fall so the denominator is going down while the price has risen over the past month The result At the market peak in February you were paying times earnings for the stock market expensive by historical standards Today you are paying times ie as we have stalled the economy lost million jobs and sent countless companies heading toward bankruptcy Stocks are MORE expensive today than they were at the all time peak two months ago Oil prices stabilized a bit but they remain incredibly volatile It s worth noting that somewhere between of US oil producers will go bankrupt if oil stays under for a prolonged period of time say through the fall COVID19 Testing Where we are about million tests a week Where we need to be million tests a week Tracking Tracing Where we are less than people in the US working on this Where we need to be analysts working on this Small Business Loans Where we are the vast majority of the first wave of billion went to banks largest customers Again this is the problem with public private partnerships without oversight If you trust a corporation to do the right thing they will do the right thing for themselves Another new round of financing of billion is set to be passed this week think about that for a moment billion in money blown in months which is like of the TARP Bailout in and no one has any idea where it s going Where we need to be I am torn on this because this feels like throwing money on campfire An extra month of rent or payroll is not going to make a difference for a lot of small businesses If you operated your business on the edge and you can not weather months being shutdown then maybe your business wasn t viable in the long run I do not love the fact that many large corporations sucked up the first billion but without oversight that money is gone Our Cultural Divide Where we are We have a divided society and no way unify our culture I will point out that all of the re open America protests are basically the work of one guy in Jacksonville He bought all of the websites populated the state sites and started the conversation on social media For all of the talk of protests states like Maryland reported that they had more media inquiries about the protests than they had actual protesters However perception is reality in our society now and the perception is that red States are full of people who need a hair cut so they are going to start opening up despite the fact that we hit new all time highs yesterday in cases and deaths Where we need to be there s no fixing this the best bet is to draw a new border from NJ to Michigan Minnesota and let the Northeast and the West Coast join Canada we can merge Montana North Dakota with Alberta Saskatchewan and give it to New TexFlorida or whatever the new country will be called sort of via Canadian smoke detectors are just a voice saying Sorry I don t want to alarm you but via I mean you have to admit it s hilarious that the people who have spent their entire lives stockpiling beans ammo and publishing newsletters about preparing to shelter in place during a global crisis are the ones having meltdowns because they can not go to the cheesecake factory via Working from home would be fantastic if everyone would stop calling and emailing me Cheers Subscribe in a reader

12277,12277,MTV Yesterday may have been a holiday but no one was working harder than the cast of The Hills Except maybe Mischa Barton who may not even be on this show anymore This week s theme break ups and make ups A quick rundown of what happened Brody and Stephanie made up Spencer and Brody made up and Stephanie tried to have a heart to heart with Justin though it did not seem like he got that their friendship might be ending Elsewhere Brandon and Ashley struggled with their new relationship Kaitlynn lambasted the world for spreading rumors about her relationship Audrina got back into business and Whitney Port was definitely there There were a lot of feelings to process so we called up Spencer Pratt to get his take on everything that happened He got a little emotional On Brandon trying to broker peace between Spencer and Brody What Brody did not get is that I do not have a problem if he wants to be all over Stephanie If he wants to have a little wrath after she disrespects his new career as a fireman that s his business I just do not want a problem with Stephanie especially at my vow renewal Did you see what she did at the bachelorette party No thank you MTV I did a lot of work to make sure I did not have a problem with Stephanie And Stephanie thank god and all his angels did not have a problem with me for the moment I wasn t going to get in the middle of their drama so she could have more content for her little podcast I wasn t being her bodyguard I was just trying to stop my mom from blowing up my phone Just say sorry and then we can have a real good time at the party Brody can have some wrath when it s not so close to my bachelor party PrattDaddy com September I get why he was frustrated though because Stephanie s been talking shit about me for nine years straight More like years straight I can see why he was like Huh Why s Spencer caping for her now I just did not want to have any beef with Stephanie It s not like he Kaitlynn and I are joining forces to vanquish that evil First Kaitlynn and I are not that close Second I do not know where we d find that much holy water Do they sell it on Amazon On Kaitlynn It s tough for me to listen to Kaitlynn complain about people talking about her allegedly open relationship with Brody when we know she had a thing going with Miley She already had something going on with her when these scenes were filming maybe not physically but definitely emotionally No one s judging you for whatever it is you and Brody do when he s not sleeping in his car We just do not want people to lie about their lives Aug at pm PDT Maybe you should not have gone on television It s called a reality show hon And the reality is that Brody s been talking about your sex life on his podcast for years Uh your open relationship is not a rumor if you talk about it on your PODCAST I guess that s something we gotta remind fools about now PrattDaddy com September My favorite is when she s like Brody and I were wild young crazy kids Was that last week Because you and Brody have only been together a minute Are you older and more mature now that you are chilling on Miley s yacht On Kaitlynn demanding people have common decency I would love to know Liam Hemsworth s thoughts on Kaitlynn s recent displays of common decency You know what I call common decency Getting it on at your Italian villa and not in front of the paparazzi MTV On Whitney I was surprised she was serving red wine because I know that stains your teeth and Whitney s all about keeping her smile arctic white I really do believe she was like Oh my god you guys You know what s worse than people talking shit about your allegedly open relationship Stained teeth But you know what s great Crest White Strips Swipe up for a discount I think Whitney talks and she just says swipe up now like it s a normal part of the conversation and then they just have to edit it out You can not swipe up on cable On Justin and Stephanie s heart to heart about his new girlfriend I will be honest I actually felt bad for my sister because it felt like she really thought she and Justin were going to end up together I knew she really liked Justin and thought she was going to win him over from Audrina and she almost did kind of Then someone with million followers on IG came in How are she and her accent gonna compete with that Sep at am PDT I definitely felt like Aw man I want those two to end up together and move to Indonesia and rob banks for a living I think this breakup is why Stephanie moved back to England But who knows These two could still be in the cards On Justin s conversation with his dad and his relationship with Audrina Maybe I am just emotional after the Labor Day traffic but I was just in my feelings this entire episode It was all yanking on me I was so sad when Justin was telling his dad about Audrina because it felt like they were really supposed to end up together I think if Audrina did not have all that drama she has with her ex husband they would have had a better chance I feel like that was the one thing that was holding him back because he was scared of how real her life is Because it is not a game She s got a daughter and he wants to be part of that but he s not ready to give up his lifestyle I am a rockstar I wear boots on the beach I do not drink coffee Who does not drink coffee On visiting the wildlife center with Brandon We were there for three hours and those two were on a freaking date It was so awesome for me I love how he tries to spin it like oh Pratt s an old perv Not at all actually You just invited me on your date with some girl that s a model and is also your age My roommate So glad you are here to help me build this dresser Me The Hills September I was told I d be meeting some hummingbirds That s why I came To feed hummers with syringes in a warm room Did that happen No All we did was pick up poop with our hands At least I got the zoom in shot at the end where Brandon was like and this is why I can not have a girlfriend Exactly because you were almost just making out with this chick in the freaking coyote enclosure Have not they been through enough On Brody and Stephanie making up I really appreciated that scene You know I wish he d have done it sooner so that way he could have been at my bachelor party We could have had it on a Wednesday because I know he does not drink on Tuesdays Stephanie s point about honesty would land a whole lot better if she dropped that accent PrattDaddy com September I know how hard it was to apologize to Stephanie when he feels like she created the entire situation but he did it He owned up to his part in it That s the Brody that I used to be friends with Somebody who would apologize and who would own up to shit and who could be real It was nice to see a glimpse of the prince of Malibu You know I heard Brody Katelyn and Stephanie were all close friends before she moved back to England So I think that apology went a long way On his make up with Brody For me it s frustrating that Brody just will not be who he is on this show I see Brody on social media and TMZ He s literally out until sunrise all the time So when we filmed it was like we are at a bikini show and this guy is acting like a librarian Where s my friend Did not know Brody was allowed to even smell vodka during the daytime But that moment between us felt very real I think we were both in the same place it s just he handled every situation on this season in an image conscious way All I needed him to do was tell me Hey we are on the same page Our friendship could have been in such a different place if he just wasn t so defensive all the time It all kind of makes more sense now that he and Kaitlynn are not together though When we started shooting the season he must have been in the middle of way more drama than the audience saw The last thing he needed was me saying You know I was pretty surprised you did not invite me to this wedding MTV He was probably like I am about to break up with this girl every day Shut up I do not care Move on Forget it That anger could have actually had more to do with her and the situation than me in retrospect But I still did not appreciate him saying do not hurt me I am not touching any of you to risk going to jail for a lawsuit or get sued None of you are worth that I am out here making millions playing with crystals and my miracle toddler You think I am going to mess all that up

1019,1019,"Oh boy do I have a story for you guys. So this is back when Heart Gold and Soul Silver were just out. I had picked up Heart Gold, and took my time beating the game during the hour and a half I had at college before my class started for the semester. After about a month of this, I'd beaten the game and gone exploring, specifically to the whirl islands. I eventually manage to find Lugia, and I had , minus this one premier ball I had. I didn't stock up on those because I didn't like the look of them, and the truck load of ultra balls I had were more useful as it was. At this point in my life, I hadn't really bothered with status-dealing pokemon or pokemon with false swipe. But I was pretty darn decent at guestimating how much damage all my pokemon could do without killing their target, and I worked out a strategy that involved sending out my Pidgeot to take the first ice beam after a quick attack. Yea, still not sure why I worked it out this way. Anyway, I get Lugia down to a sliver of health before I start chucking every ball I had at this thing. It just. Wouldn't. Stay. In. The ball. It had taken me about five minutes to get the dumb bird's health to where I had wanted, but I spent the rest of that entire hour throwing balls at this thing. I went in order of all my best balls, until finally only my premier ball remained. Once, , heck. So I reset, cursing my bad luck, and set up to try again. My two friends got back as Pidgeot used quick attack at Lugia, and noticed that my Pideot hadn't gone down. Well heck, I think, the Pidgeot fainting to Lugia was Integral to The Plan. So, sighing deeply as I explain my poor luck with the previous Lugia to my friends, I threw out the premier ball to stall. Why not, right? Dings once, 'what' from all three of us in unison. ‚Äã And that's why I still have a Lugia named ""what."""
6201,6201,Few people have played such a major role in avant garde fashion over the last years as Martin Margiela His work has inspired countless designers Raf Simons who saw Margiela s iconic White show in has confessed that it inspired him to shift directions from interiors to fashion As Marc Jacobs said in Anybody who s aware of what life is in a contemporary world is influenced by Margiela In however years after Martin launched his label the Maison and its founder are experiencing something of a victory lap The usually hermetic designer is stepping out to soak up some of his glory First off there s the long awaited documentary Margiela in His Own Words The film directed by Reiner Holzemer will offer unprecedented access to a man who has meticulously avoided the glare of the spotlight Secondly this year a decade after after he sold Maison Margiela to Renzo Rosso and resigned as creative designer and since he became the first recipient of the ANDAM Fashion Award he s returning to judge the prize that helped make his name In a rare statement Martin spoke about leaving the industry and the state of fashion today Many say that fashion has a short memory as it is obsessed by actuality and novelty But some recent exhibitions about my work exemplified the opposite he said Again my homeland Belgium was the first to honour my work at the MOMU Antwerp and then my adoptive city Paris followed with two more at Palais Galliera and Mus√©e des Arts D√©coratifs A beautiful tribute to a period of hard work and dedication starting at early age and lasting for more than years until the very year I felt that I could not cope any more with the worldwide increasing pressure and the overgrowing demands of trade I also regretted the overdose of information carried by social media destroying the thrill of wait and cancelling every effect of surprise so fundamental for me But today I am happy to notice again a growing interest for creativity in fashion by some upcoming designers Given how far reaching and pervasive his touch on the world of fashion has been and to mark this special year in his history we asked four people who knew and worked with Martin Margiela about his influence on them and his enduring legacy Kristina De Coninck My First My Last My Everything Fellow Belgian Kristina De Coninck was an artist who became Margiela s favourite model and muse and they have remained good friends until this day Kristina became a model almost by accident when at she was scouted in an Antwerp caf√© where photographer Ronald Stoops husband of Margiela s favourite make up artist Inge Grognard Antwerp really is a small town earned some extra money as pulling pints He convinced her to go to a casting call for designer Dirk Van Saene one of the Antwerp Six Martin Margiela saw the resulting shoot and the rest is history Kristina moved to Paris rented a tiny apartment and started to work with Martin Martin showed so much respect to all of us in the way he was talking about the models Many of my happiest memories with Martin are related to the music we listened to we had so much fun together In one of his shows at The Conciergerie in Paris and also during his exhibition in the Mus√©e Galli√®ra last year he included my favourite song Loving You by Minnie Ripperton Can you imagine how that made me feel So much joy Then I think about the moments where we had some crazy laughs moments that I felt so understood by him The moments when I saw him working he was so focused often I would just melt watching him Often Martin showed me what he had made it was not fashion it was totally different it was original and I still know what it looked like I was touched that he shared these moments with me Thanks to him I learned that in life you need guts courage determination but all these strong words only make sense when there s also a place for sensitivity tenderness attention devotion taking care and believing in yourself To abstract an entire life in one sentence is not that easy but I am thinking about a love song Barry White s My First My Last My Everything and dancing together with him heaven Jean Paul Gaultier I admire him for his uncompromising stance on creation Famously Martin Margiela s first job in Paris was working for Jean Paul Gaultier who has called him the best assistant he ever had I was on the jury at the Antwerp Academy for the graduate show of the class which is now known as the Antwerp Six Martin was a year older and I had heard about his work but had not seen him A friend of mine who worked at the Lib√©ration newspaper asked me to see him When I met him and I saw his work I told him immediately that he was ready for his own line and that he did not need an apprenticeship But he insisted that he would like to work with me He stayed with me for three years he was my best assistant he became my friend and when he told me that he wanted to leave and start his own line I could only wish him good luck I think that some of the things that he decided to do were in reaction to what he saw while working for me I was part of the first generation of designers who were starting to get mediatised and he chose total anonymity to never be photographed or interviewed I think also that we share the love for le trompe √† l oeil and reinterpretations of the classics I have always admired him for his uncompromising stance on creation and for his strength to stay away from fashion once he had decided to stop Sonja No√´l I did not know what to think of his first collection was it beautiful or ugly Brussels shop owner Sonja No√´l is as passionate about fashion today as when she opened her first store Stijl on rue Dansaert in Brussels where she sells brands such as Ann Demeulemeester Rick Owens Haider Ackermann Dries Van Noten Y Project Raf Simons and Martin Margiela She opened the first Martin Margiela shop in Europe in in a th century house in Brussels I remember his first show very well mostly because I could not attend it as I was having my first baby on that day I watched a video of the show afterwards saw the clothes in his showroom and did not know what to think of the collection was it beautiful or ugly Margiela cut jackets with very narrow shoulders and sleeves at a time where everybody else showed jackets with wide power shoulders His wide trousers had pre made knee shapes in them and the seams were raw and unfinished In a way I loved it so I ordered the entire collection and got the showpieces since Martin s first collection did not even go into production I still have some of those pieces and plan to donate them to a fashion museum in Brussels Then when I opened the Margiela shop he came over from Paris to tell me how the shop should look he took photos of everything and drew on them with a white marker We put in old wooden doors heavy glass windows white marble floors crystal lamps everything was recycled and got a lick of white paint we put white gauze on the lamps and made the shop look intimate Martin knew exactly what he wanted and I respect that a lot His work was always a revelation always new and surprising From the locations of his shows to the invitations he sent out to the media and the buyers his choice of models how their hair and make up was done Then there were the collections themselves he did not do pre collections so as buyers we never knew what to expect Martin gave us so many ideas in his years that it will inspire designers for years to come He was an artist In his refusal to communicate about his designs his clothes told his story He influenced the way that I think about fashion enormously Demna Gvasalia To destroy in order to create Demna Gvasalia had his first job after graduating from the Antwerp Royal Academy of Fine Arts at Maison Margiela in Paris He is now one of the most lauded designers working the creative director of Balenciaga and at his own label VETEMENTS where he has constantly paid tribute to the energy and spirit Martin instilled in him I think of my time spent working at Margiela as a sort of masters programme after graduating from Antwerp Working there I discovered that beauty can be found in everything around us mundane objects can be turned into creative concepts and become a completely new product I never worked with or met Margiela himself but through the work that I discovered in the archives I educated myself he sparked my curiosity about clothing I discovered that creativity can mould something great and completely new from left overs and next to nothing Margiela made me think clothes His approach justified for me the idea that creativity needs to be limitless I learned at Margiela that one can make a garment from an old supermarket bag I also discovered the immense creativity that comes from having limited resources In this way it justified my own creative identity At Margiela I learned more about clothes about falling in love with them turning them inside out or upside down all the things that I have loved ever since I can remember At Margiela I learned that you may need to destroy an old garment to create a new one This may be one of the most important things I learned from the legacy of Margiela to destroy in order to create

8960,8960,This is post in the series Click here for part one and here for part two Pro tip click on any picture in this series to find out more about it Fun cocktail party fact the word for drunkenness in ancient Greek is methe pronounced m√©th ee Actually you already knew that How Because it or rather she since the noun is grammatically feminine shows up in English in the words crystal meth and a methyst An amethyst is the gemstone you wear to keep the lady at bay Methe was never really an official goddess in ancient Greece but since people do worship her Greek artists thought she made a great allegory What s more that allegory works in two ways since like drunkenness in English methe canmean either intoxication getting drunk or addiction alcoholism In The Art of Drinking Obsopoeus exploits that ambiguity at several points especially in the teaser he ends book onewith The next book depicts the haunting portraits and problems of Drunkenness composed by me in classical verse You binge drinker who are constantly getting hammered look at them as if you were looking in a mirror and see how truly disgraceful the sight is Once you ve seen Drunkenness you should turn and run from her for all your life if you love the glory of true sobriety As he repeatedly says Obsopoeus thinks getting buzzed or tipsy is okay but getting drunk hammered blitzed is wrong It s a distinction worth bearing in mind Moreover in speaking of portraits here Obsopoeus means what he says literally but in a totally surprising way He starts book two by referring to Apelles one of the greatest of the old master painters of ancient Greece years ago Think Raphael Michelangelo Artemisia Gentilischi and you are on the right track Among the paintings of Apelles those monuments of old that learn√®d Greece celebrates in its writings his ingenious hand left behind a masterpiece It surpasses both the Venuses he created the one of her emerging naked from the waves of the sea and the other for the people of Kos that he only managed to get a start on I ll describe that picture though its excellence outdoes my song and its precious art defeats my verses The picture at right is a Renaissance recreation by Titian of the first one of Apelles lost paintings of Venus mentioned here the the Venus Anadyomene He painted it around the year sixteen years before Obsopoeus wrote The Art of Drinking Apelles other lost painting of Venus the Aphrodite of Kos was also recreated in the Renaissance by Botticelli in the s I am sure you have seen it Like Botticelli and Titian Obsopoeus also wants to recreate a painting by Apelles The difference is that instead of using pigments he s going to use poetry In formal terms Obsopoeus is going to give us an ekphrasis That s the fancy term for a poet s attempt to outdo the beauty of a painting by describing that painting in beautiful language It s an ancient and classical technique and as a rule rather than exception the poet s description ends up far more artificially alive and animated than any painting could ever be That s true here too Obsopoeus spends the next few hundred lines describing a painting you could call The Garden of Drunkenness It s a sweeping allegory for people who cannot stop partying when the party is over The crazy thing is though no such painting by Apelles ever existed Obsopoeus made the whole thing up inspired it seems primarily by Hieronymus Bosch s triptych The Garden of Earthly Delights That s the painting featured at the top of this post Here s a wonderful short video introduction to the painting Like Bosch Obsopoeus painting shows us a green field filled with flowers and people Unlike Bosch his people are leisurely drinking wine at a festive gathering and when the party s over most of them get up and go home Others can not or will not though Instead those people head for a walled garden in the center of the field The garden is full of bad figures like Hangover Dementia Self Indulgence Memory Loss Depression and a few others And then Presiding in the center of the garden is a woman in royal raiment drunk and surrounded by an entourage of women A grassy garland s encircling her styled hair and she s holding a phiale in her hands as if she s about to drink from it As I studied these details at first I thought the queen standing in their midst was Circe but it wasn t her It was Drunkenness labeled in Greek letters Methe Queen of all Wine Drinkers This is a glass phiale or shallow wine bowl from the time of Apelles now in the Corning Museum of Glass in central New York By telling us that Methe is holding a phiale in her hands as if she s about to drink from it Obsopoeus is doing something quite extraordinary To wit at this central moment in his imaginary ancient Greek painting of Drunkenness drinking from a phiale he s alluding to a real ancient Greek painting of Drunkenness drinking from a phiale that once hung inside a shrine in Epidaurus Greece and a famous one to boot That painting was not by Apelles but by Pausias th c BC another old master of ancient Greece And what made it so famous is that it depicted Methe drinking wine from a crystal phiale with her face visible through the glass Not an easy feat Pausias painting is lost but his idea was imitated in the late Renaissance by Annibale Caracci long after Obsopoeus death That s it at left I will come back to this point in a minute Meanwhile what happens in the Garden of Drunkenness As you might guess things go badly The people inside continue drinking until they pass out They transform into animals sheep pigs donkeys monkeys and when they wake up they start vomiting or attacking each other in a wild frenzy Some try to escape the Garden but they are met by an entourage of old women as they do The women lash the people trying to leave they handcuff the compliant ones and bludgeon the resisters and ultimately enslave them all Obsopoeus then tells us their names Fever Edema Psoriasis Poverty Old Age and yes Death Yikes Obsopoeus allegorical painting is haunting and glorious It s the climax of the whole poem and clearly designed to be Rather than go into more detail though I d like to share related material with you that I did not have room for in How to Drink In my last post I quoted a liminary poem in Greek by the Renaissance scholar Joachim Camerarius In fact Camerarius wrote two Greek poems for Obsopoeus book and I m pleased to present the other one here It s a miniature masterpiece and it s a fantastic specimen of how learned and playful Renaissance poetry can be It alludes to the Garden of Drunkenness by way of Pausias painting and you could call it Poetry is a Painted Crystal Bowl Like Obsopoeus Camerarius is struck by the inherent competition between representing reality in the written word vs the painter s art He heightens the similarity between those two arts by punning on the similarity of words used to describe each In his view Obsopoeus written engraphon poetry is as beautifully skillfully and clearly executed as Pausias painted graphike crystal bowl because through each one you can discern the orderly rethe features of disorderly Methe Drunkenness Here s the poem They say there was this one work of the painter s art by Pausias that was really worth seeing Drunkenness drinking from a glass phiale that she was tipping up while facing forward so that her whole face showed through and though the bowl covered her lips and eyes all her features were still quite clear Unquestionably then this a painting like that was a work of art But a greater work of art is the written one in your hands by our friend Vincent It has the gorgeous adornment of the Muses verses it teaches you how to drink a lot with understanding and without harm and it has found a system in an unsystematic business In it not only will you be able to view Drunkenness you can consort with her and with pleasure and understanding Here s the Greek for those of you who can read it I ve highlighted and color coded the many words that correspond or pun on each other in each part of the simile Œ†Œ±œÖœÉŒêŒµœâ œÑŒ≠œáŒΩŒ∑œÇ

Well this stuff isn't bad per se, 't very moisturising, feels nice on but doesn't stay on long, doesn't add any shine. It's a 25ml tube but I have to reapply so often that it won't last very long.

Make sure that you have a good Interstate or Exide made Battery or (Optima Red or Yellow if you want to spend the cash) [timal ! Buy one of these [url] ?backurl=search%2Fproducts%3Fsearch_terms%3Dvoltage%252Bregulator%26top_parent%3D200001%26year%3D[/url] or [url] ,GR540B,voltage+regulator,4884[/url] 3. Make sure that you have a Quality Starter solenoid. IMHO, This is one of the biggest woes of new Classic Ford (They are all trash) other than a Motorcraft, Standard Motor Parts or Original OEM Autolite starter solenoid will leave you stranded on the road somewhere or in your own driveway in no time flat. DO NOT use Repro Solenoids either (Also Trash). Classic cases of one of these starter solenoids going bad is the car still runs with the ignition key removed, or just does not start at all, or even worse, The starter stays engaged while the car is still running! I've seen that one too. So get a good [url] ?backurl=search%2Fproducts%3Fsearch_terms%3Dsolenoid%26top_parent%3D1%26year%3D[/url] Once you've done all three things above, You are NOW ready to diagnose your car. You say that you have a grinding noise. That could be the Flywheel and Torque Converter scraping up against each ""crapping out"" on you causing one of the conditions that I mentioned above. The exact car that you own is a pleasure to drive and die-hard reliable if you do the right things and use the correct parts. I can vouch for that as I have two of 're here to help.

10885,10885,This is another long ass chapter which means it s another stand alone installment I want to keep you hungry for more as opposed to wearing you out with overkill verbiage I don t want my snappy dialogue to make you snap crackle or even pop In this chapter our narrator makes a major mistake after making a string of Hitchcock references The events in this chapter are purely fictional much like the law school murders themselves Since part of this installment takes place in a Garden District carriage house this Byrds classic gets a shout out A reminder that you can catch up on Project Novel by clicking here Our story continues after the break CHAPTER It felt strange to be walking through the Quarter on a Friday night with Monique Gautreaux As we strolled down Decatur Street I enjoyed seeing her amused reactions to a crowd of drunken college boys who were hollering Let s get wasted Finals are over Party She paused in front of a vintage clothing store to admire a cape displayed in the window I caught a wistful smile creeping across her face For the first time Gautreaux appeared to be very human to me As a law professor she was as aloof and distant as most of that odd breed but tonight she was worried Scared Her teaching style was authoritarian in the French manner as if she were Charles DeGaulle in a designer suit with matching pumps But off stage she seemed to be soft spoken and thoughtful I wondered which was the act tonight or her classroom style She swiveled around and smiled at me You find me strange do you not Mr Pappas No Professor Gautreaux I said shaking my head I think a better word would be exotic Call me Nicholas or Nick please I was unsettled by how perceptive she was I did think she was strange And I m Monique I believe tonight is the first time we have ever met socially Actually there were a few parties at Amalia s old place that we both went to Oh yes She has a way of either bringing people together or of driving them apart she laughed so quietly that it was almost inaudible I find you tres sympathetique Nicholas especially at a dreadful moment like this I never imagined that I would be suspected of murder Suddenly my life is like a Hitchcock film I tried to restrain my amusement but failed and started laughing out loud too loud Monique s face hardened into a mask looking both puzzled and vexed I owed her an explanation Please forgive me I said I m not laughing at you It s just that you ve always reminded me of a Hitchcock heroine a cool chic blonde And believe me it s meant as a compliment Even the way you usually wear your hair so tightly pulled back reminds me of Grace Kelly before she married Prince Reindeer Monique laughed softly as if unused to laughing at all I was relieved that she was flattered and not offended As we moved on I extended the cinematic analogy hoping to get beneath the layers of charm and to the truth But I never thought of you as one of Hitchcock s wrong men so to speak a murder suspect I hesitated for a moment I decided to play dumb and pretend to know nothing about her dealings with the police Tell me have the police questioned you since Steve Cohn was attacked She scraped her teeth across her lower lip and nodded Look I have no right to ask you this I said slowly and you don t have to answer But I ve heard that you were sexually harassed by Maragall and Cohn and that you may have had an affair with Cohn She bristled when I mentioned Cohn s name Her posture stiffened and that imperious off putting classroom tone crept back into her voice I would rather have sex with a rattlesnake than with Mr Cohn The snake at least warns before it strikes But what about the rumors of sexual harassment I felt rude and intrusive but I was going soft on her and wanted to somehow help But I would only help if her story was consistent with the one she d told Camille I m soft hearted not soft headed Monique stopped walking and paused to think She took my arm and led me into Jackson Square We sat down on a semi circular bench near the statue of Old Hickory She looked at me as if I were a student posing a particularly annoying question Finally and hesitantly she spoke in her soft off stage voice It is true Both Cohn and Maragall implied that having sex with them would help my career I was appalled that these supposedly distinguished professors would make such an offer That man Maragall repelled me to my very soul If Cohn was a snake then Maragall was an odious little toad puffed up with self love I never considered agreeing to their disgusting offers Nicholas That would have been fucking and I never fuck I make love Did you report these threats to Dean Granger Monique bit her lip leaving red lipstick on her teeth Mais non Alas their language was too ambiguous to constitute a strong case of sexual harassment I hated myself for not reporting them but whose word would they have taken mine or Maragall s As for Cohn I knew that he and Maragall were allies I nodded Maragall was the real power at Tulane Law School and his word was sacred Praise be to Salvador R I P If I wanted my American career to continue I could not burn my bridges with a powerful man like Maragall I am not proud of it but if I were a man toadying to an overbearing boss it would be called practical But of course that changed and I told the police everything That is why they suspect me of murder But I am innocent She paused for a second to allow her story to sink in Then she put her hand on top of mine Do you think Mr Benjamin and I are the sole suspects Not as far as I know I believe there are several other suspects I said Also Benjamin s alienated the police They like him as much as I do and you just saw what dear friends we are Shall we walk some more I stood up and offered her my arm We walked past the Cabildo and then headed down Chartres Street It was slow going because Monique wasn t exactly wearing walking shoes but I didn t mind it was a beautiful night and I was in no hurry to escape the company of this strange and lovely woman I almost suggested going to Napoleon House for a drink but what I had to ask her was too personal to bring up in a bar Finally we came upon my parked car As I unlocked the door I said Where do you live The Garden District at the corner of Camp and First Street I know the neighborhood I have a friend who lives nearby The friend of course was Hope I wondered if we might see Hope and that man going into her place What had they done that evening What were they doing right now I was feeling jealous and Monique was looking more enticing every minute Once inside the car Monique buckled up and said I have a charming place I believe it was once inhabited by slaves servants or meddlesome in laws But since it is called a carriage house it could have also housed horses A Chestnut Mare perhaps Pardon me I m sorry It s an old song by the Byrds about a wild mare I see she said with a mischievous grin I also doubt that any wild wild horses ever lived there We drove Uptown in silence I pondered Monique s story as I drove up Magazine Street I found her quiet protestations of innocence to be as compelling as I suddenly found her But there were a few open questions Had she and Sophia really been lovers What about the time she d been hospitalized for depression I was skeptical that Monique s depression had made her homicidal most depressed people are too numb to hurt anyone other than themselves I felt that Camille was overeager to believe that a few weeks in a psych ward had turned Monique from Professor Jekyll into Ms Hyde the deranged killer I also had a hard time picturing the perfectly coifed and dressed Monique sliding a calf s tongue into a gift bow I looked over at Monique and caught her smiling at me After noticing my glance the smile vanished and she gazed out the window When we crossed Jackson Street the borderline of the Garden District I turned right on Second Street and then right again onto Camp As I pulled the car over to the curb I wondered if I had the guts to ask her about Sophia or her depression I doubted it I was still intimidated by her austere reserve and icy bearing I was wallowing in uncertainty when Monique smiled bashfully and said Thank you for the ride She put her hand on my shoulder Would you like to come in for a drink I quickly accepted I was curious to see her place We entered through a side gate into an overgrown garden that I d often passed on the way to Hope s Since Anne Rice lived nearby the yard reminded me of Louis the vampire s untamed garden This inspired me to admire Monique s long neck which looked very bitable indeed My fantasy was soon broken by the mosquitoes that began dining on my own neck The white carriage house was surprisingly large It emitted a garish yellow glow because of the bug lights that lit our way I watched Monique struggling to unlock the door s multiple locks Please forgive the mess she said as she turned on the lights There was no mess to forgive like Monique herself the flat was impeccably tidy and orderly It was sparsely furnished with ultra modern furniture of what looked like a neo Bauhaus design The only mildly discordant note was a pile of blue books stacked on the table As I looked around I felt a breeze from ceiling fans swirling some twelve feet above my head Back in old New Orleans even slave quarters had high ceilings There were only a few pictures hanging on the stark off white walls but one caught my eye Over the couch was a black and white Man Ray nude photograph and the woman in it looked like a photocopy of Monique I pointed at it and said Is that actually a Man Ray and Monique blushed which briefly brought color to her pale iridescent skin Yes it is a Man Ray original But of course I am not the model That is my mother back in her Bohemian days in Paris before the war Yo mama I thought but didn t say I walked toward the sofa so I could take a closer look I m impressed Man Ray is one of my favorite artists I turned around and smiled at her She s beautiful you look just like her How well did your mother know Man Ray Quite well she said with a closemouthed smile But I am the one who is impressed Most law students undoubtedly think that Man Ray is a sea beast on view at the Aquarium We both laughed I sat down while Monique poured sherry into two small cut crystal glasses She came over and sat beside me on the pristine white sofa I hope you do not mind sherry It is all that I have I guess a Frenchwoman should be ashamed of having no wine but I drink very little Oh no I like sherry I hesitated for a moment Do you mind if I m blunt and even intrusive again She shook her head but her shoulders curled up tensely She fixed her green eyes on the floor away from me Monique I hope you believe that I want to help you at least I d like to try Can I ask you a few more rather intimate questions Her body became even more rigid as if prematurely afflicted with rigor mortis She raised her eyes from the floor and stared at me coolly I should mind but go ahead I d gotten the green light but I was still reluctant to ask about her time in a psychiatric hospital I understand that you had some health problems in the past I said Is that what you want to know She looked relieved then kicked off her shoes and put her feet up on the glass coffee table I am not ashamed to talk about it I was ill I suffered a severe depression many years ago and was hospitalized for three weeks And last year it worsened again because of the work related stress that we discussed earlier I understand that you re taking medication So that is what this is all about I should have known you know Mr Doucet and he is single minded on that subject Yes I ve been taking Prozac for years and it is the best thing that has ever happened to me I was surprised by how relaxed she seemed to be She didn t act like someone with anything to hide I knew that she might be using me to pass information to the police but I didn t care I was getting used to being used Some people claim that they ve experienced horrible side effects from Prozac I said It s already been used as a diminished capacity argument in several homicide cases the Prozac defense That is ridiculous nonsense peddled by greedy lawyers and demented cultists Prozac ended a crippling depression that left me inert and hopeless But your Monsieur Doucet is stubborn He refuses to believe my doctor s written assurances I am frustrated but I understand that he is too because of their failure to make an arrest You re surprisingly charitable I understand why I am suspected she said softly The police do not understand mental health problems They want you to be either sane or mad and have no patience for gray areas Furthermore I do not have a good alibi But the primary reason that I can be charitable is that I am innocent I think the police will eventually reach the same conclusion Yes I hated Cohn and Maragall but I believe that God deals with vermin like them But why would I harm Bill Sutton or Sophia Kostecki I knew him only as one of my students and I was once quite fond of her How fond I asked myself before asking her There s one more thing I said cautiously And I m afraid it s even more personal than my other questions About Sophia and myself Yes I was nervous but I d waded too deeply into this swamp to test whether land or quicksand lay ahead Is it true that you and Sophia were lovers Monique frowned at me and we sat silently for what felt like days My question lingered in the air like the aroma of shellfish after boiling and I couldn t tell if the smell was pleasant or foul to her I hoped that she felt that she could trust me My skepticism had faded and I wanted to help her if I could She bit her lip again If you promise to keep this between us I will tell you the truth I had to think about it I didn t know if I could keep that particular promise but I decided to play along She sighed softly and sipped her sherry Sophia and I were briefly lovers It is something I am not proud of not because she was a woman but because she was a student But I could not resist her And it was she who pursued me It was no surprise that Sophia had been the pursuer Whenever she d wanted something or someone she was more tenacious than a golden retriever chasing a fallen bird I leaned forward and said Is it true that you were angry at Sophia for violating your confidence Monique s voice wavered slightly but she remained calm Of course I felt betrayed but I should have known better That was Sophia s nature she was incapable of silence or discretion Although I kept my distance from her after that I did not pursue a vendetta against her and I did not kill her She began to cry at first in her characteristically soft way then she sobbed deeply gulping for breath Her tears moved me I ignored her professorial reserve and put my arms around her I am so embarrassed she said in between gulps I do not cry easily I hold everything inside I have not cried for Sophia until now As she wept I felt her breasts rubbing against my chest and tried not to become too aroused But it was difficult once she d let her defenses down Monique was irresistible I was very turned on but the timing was terrible She was suspected of murder and I was in love with Hope But was Hope really in love with me My doubts had exploded after I saw her with that damn boyfriend they looked like they were posing for a happy couple picture What were they doing right now Were they making love in her bed right around the corner Jealousy is like a fever it makes you do things that you ll regret when it has faded Another gulp from Monique reminded me that I had a sobbing woman on my hands I tried to comfort her and to forget about seduction I patted her back It s okay it s okay I cooed Go ahead and cry Let it go it ll make you feel better I was finally confident that Monique was incapable of murder I only hoped that this belief wasn t erotically inspired She looked up at me I ve gotten mascara all over your shirt I am so sorry Don t be Do you feel better now I know that you Catholics believe that confession is good for the soul I smiled at her Of course I learned that from Monty Clift in I Confess Monique laughed and sat up She wiped her red eyes with a hot pink handkerchief I do not recall a cool chic blonde in that particular Hitchcock film Well Monique you don t look particularly cool or chic right now I don t think that I ve ever seen you with a single hair out of place before I smiled noticing that her flawless makeup had washed away I was excited by her sudden imperfection Perfection seems to be my curse she said as if she d read my mind I try so hard to be professorial that sometimes I lose touch with my true nature which is an amorous one She smiled and leaned forward to kiss me I felt a brief twinge of guilt as our tongues played Twister but I was too aroused to stop I felt her hands wandering down my torso at the same time as my hands moved up hers to unbutton her blouse She whispered softly in my ear I d like to request a change of venue shall we move onto the bed She led me into the bedroom We fell onto the bed and began frantically undressing each other Monique hadn t exaggerated when she told me that she had an amorous nature The next morning I was awakened by sunlight peeking through the blinds I rolled over and saw Monique lying on her side her long legs dangling over the edge of the bed She smiled at me which proved that last night wasn t just a fantasy I also had red lip prints all over my body I leaned back against the headboard and noticed that the clothes that had been hastily thrown around the room the night before lay neatly folded on the dresser I d be willing to bet that Monique even irons her underwear It was hard to connect the distant and haughty Professor Gautreaux with the passionate woman I d made love with all night long But I was guilty of mistaking her professional image for reality I should have known better all of us at Tulane Law School were actors in a farce that had gone sour Monique had regained her poise after a night of distress confession abandon and sexual release She rolled over and leaned her head on my shoulder I shall be the blunt one this time she said You know Nicholas I must leave here as soon as the police will allow it I cannot get involved with anyone right now even a man as attractive and sympathetic as you Do you think I have reverted to type I laughed and stroked her surprisingly long blonde hair Why had she always worn it so tightly coiled in a bun Surely a woman could look professional without wearing her hair so tightly pulled back that it looked painful Of course not Monique I said Last night you unloaded some heavy baggage and I was more or less the night porter No no If we had met under different circumstances I believe that we could have had more than one night together But right now both my career and freedom are at stake I must be selfish and think only of myself Do you find that horrid I shook my head Just human It s okay I m seeing someone right now She lives around the corner Right now we have an open relationship because she s about to end a long distance relationship with another man I m giving her just enough rope to hang him with I added with perhaps undue optimism She sat up and leaned against the headboard I d aroused her curiosity which only seemed fair given how much she d aroused me Is she someone I might know she said One of your classmates No way I snorted with disgust I ve gone that route before and wound up with shark bites on my neck I told her a little about Hope but not that I felt guilty about stepping out on her It s easier to talk about having an open relationship than it is to have one maybe I m not as sophisticated as I like to think I am She is a lucky woman she said But in case the cream curdles give me your address and phone number Who knows Perhaps we shall meet again in more favorable circumstances I decided it was time to offer her my services in another way Look do you want me to pass on anything to Doucet Yes please I have told him the same story that I told you but I have something to add This is hard for me She took a deep breath before continuing Tell him that I was hospitalized because I wanted to end my own life not that of another I kissed her on the forehead then pulled back and looked her in the eye I ll tell him and that I think no that I know that you re not a murderer She smiled and lay down on top of me Thank you for saying that After repeated police interrogations you begin to doubt yourself She kissed me deeply which awakened me as quickly as a cup of espresso I hoped that she wasn t motivated simply by gratitude but that she had ulterior motives she was definitely getting a rise out of me I wiggled my eyebrows suggestively and whispered How about a quickie for new time s sake She smiled and began kissing her way down my chest Then she paused for a second looked up at me licked her lips and said Nicholas the word quickie is far too vulgar to be in my vocabulary ¬© by Peter AthasThe next installment will be posted on Friday See you then

3087,3087,"16 hours ago, Arch3rAc3 said: -Is it happening with other rockets as well? -Does it really happens ""every time"", how many times have you tested? -Does the perfomance/time indicator on the top-left of the screen ever turns to yellow or red during the ascent and close to the crash? -Do you have the Making History DLC installed / if so, are you making use of any of it's new parts? Although I'm on the xbox, I did not have this problem happening as of yet. Some more details would be welcome! I have made different variations of the rocket you see in the video and the game still crashes, yes, EVERYTIME. I have tried roughly 15 times, even on a different launch pad. What you see in the video is what happens literally everytime. Two seconds after the video ends is when the game crashes, no performance issues at all. It's a relatively new game in career mode. I have only two satellites, one orbiting Kerbin and one orbiting the Mun, so there is zero lag and the game runs perfectly smooth. Then it crashes. Yes I have the DLC installed and I am using at least one part that I know of; the lander. As for additional information, I used the exact same rocket (except without the additional two boosters) in the video to actually get to the Mun and get out of orbit of the Mun. Problem was that I always ran out of fuel before I could correct my trajectory to land on Kerbin, so I added two extra boosters, and that's when the game started crashing.

10780,10780,Objective We built India Allele Finder an online searchable database and command line tool that gives researchers access to variant frequencies of Indian Telugu individuals using publicly available fastq data from the Genomes Project Access to appropriate population based genomic variant annotation can accelerate the interpretation of genomic sequencing data In particular exome analysis of individuals of Indian descent will identify population variants not reflected in European exomes complicating genomic analysis for such individuals Results India Allele Finder offers improved ease of use to investigators seeking to identify and annotate sequencing data from Indian populations We describe the use of India Allele Finder to identify common population variants in a disease quartet whole exome dataset reducing the number of candidate single nucleotide variants from to India Allele Finder is freely available to investigators to annotate genomic sequencing data from Indian populations Use of India Allele Finder allows efficient identification of population variants in genomic sequencing data and is an example of a population specific annotation tool that simplifies analysis and encourages international collaboration in genomics research Keywords Introduction Whole exome sequencing WES has revolutionized genomic diagnostics and is a key tool in identifying the causal genes underlying rare Mendelian disorders A critical strategy in post sequencing analysis involves screening a proband s exome variants against exomes from reference individuals matching the ethnic makeup of the proband While these data are widely available for individuals from European and African American descent such reference data is less accessible when analyzing exomes from individuals from India We present India Allele Finder IAF an online database table of allele frequencies of individuals from the Indian subcontinent The Genomes web browser effectively presents complete allele frequencies but rapid queries are more difficult and annotation of local variant call files vcfs is not possible In contrast the IAF website and its accompanying command line tool are focused only on the South Indian population and allow researchers to easily annotate their own exome data sets Clinicians who want a more ordered method of browsing Genome data will find the query based website intuitive to use while bioinformaticians who work with vcfs will easily adopt the IAF command line tool into their workflow Main text Accessing Genomes data Fastq data of individuals specific to Indian populations flagged with ITU indicating Indian Telugu ancestry available via the Genomes Project were aggregated via ftp from the Genomes Project and combined into two fastq files per individual one per paired end read We downloaded fastqs out of available ITU individuals from the Genomes data set Automated shell scripts facilitated the downloading of fastq files while an aggregator written in Python concatenated fastqs of the appropriate paired end such that each individual had two fastq files of equal size Data analysis Fastqs were mapped with the Burrows Wheeler alignment BWA tool 9a to hg19 The resulting bam files were then analyzed with SAMtools 19 Picard and the Genome Analysis Toolkit GATK 1 Annotation of resulting vcfs was performed with Annovar A command line Python script indiaAlleleAnnotator py takes as its input a tab delineated vcf and outputs a modified vcf with an additional column representing the allele frequency among the Indian Telugu population Database schema The vcf generated from the analysis was converted into structured query language SQL format and imported into mysql v 14 14 database as one table The database is accessed on line via a Perl Catalyst front end The files for this implementation including the raw SQL file are available at Lab IndiaAlleleFinder IAF allows query of variants through its web based database as well as providing a command line tool to annotate exome vcfs Accepted formats for the web based query include gene symbol variant genomic location or rsID number The command line annotation tool identifies variants that are present in the IAF data set and therefore likely to be population variants that may be excluded from further analysis in disease gene identification studies The IAF workflow is represented in Fig Fig Workflow of analysis of publicly available ITU fastqs from Genomes used to construct the IAF dataset Users wishing to annotate exome results with frequency data from IAF may do so using web based or the command line interface IAF use case study Subjects MP14 a1 MP14 a2 two siblings presenting with achalasia addisonianism alacrima syndrome AAAS as well as the father and mother were selected for study Saliva derived DNA underwent WES using the Agilent Sure Select Mb whole exome capture kit and basepair paired end reads were generated on an Illumina HiSeq machine at the University of Rochester Genomics Research Center Sequence was aligned analyzed as described previously De novo autosomal recessive and X linked variants were identified and common variants in the database of single nucleotide polymorphisms dbSNP version excluded We then used IAF to identify and exclude variants found in the Telugu Indian individuals from Genomes After filtering by pedigree hypothesis candidate variants were reduced from to seven when using IAF We found that MP14 a1 and MP15 a2 were homozygous for c 43C>A p Q15K variant a known AAAS sequence variation Their mother and father were both heterozygous for this variant The analysis of exome data from populations other than European and African American can be challenging due to difficulty accessing appropriate normal population data sets This can result in an excess of candidate variants in disease gene identification studies We have designed IAF to fit into existing workflows There are differences between results reported in Genomes vs IAF Overall the IAF data set reports fewer variants likely due to our use of the newer version GATK v3 1 1 versus v2 4 Additionally we sampled from a smaller group of individuals Genomes overall collected data from individuals from different populations for their phase study As a result Genomes aggregated over million entries for chromosome alone Our data set for chromosome contains entries aggregated from individuals We anticipate more variants will be represented in IAF as more exomes from the Indian continental population are added Limitations IAF is a proof of concept implementation of a filtering mechanism based on population derived variant frequencies It is a unique tool to further annotate vcfs for the specific purpose of analyzing WES data from individuals of Indian subcontinent descent We anticipate a proliferation of reference databases for populations that are not of European origin Additional features are planned for the IAF website including the ability to input multiple variants and access a subset of the vcf output corresponding to the genes and or variants queried Further exome data sets from individuals of continental Indian ancestry will be added in the future as they become available Abbreviations GATK Authors contributions JFZ study design acquisition analysis and interpretation of data manuscript

Marcel takes the first bite of the madeleine cookie when Toad smells that warm buttered toast all these are moments in literature in which food has stepped in and has moved us has made us feel something affirming Of course food s presence in literature is not all candy bars and fancy French cookies Food appears constantly in the books we read but its presence serves many purposes beyond those of inspiration and nostalgia As eaters we ourselves learn important lessons from our experiences with food that like it turns out you should not eat an entire jar of peanut butter in one sitting but we also learn important lessons from our favorite characters experiences with food When Alice drinks the vials labeled DRINK ME we are all sitting at home turning the pages furiously and shouting

7027,7027,Bohdan Bilyk Background Efforts to construct the Streptomyces host strain with enhanced yields of heterologous product have focussed mostly on engineering of primary metabolism and or the deletion of endogenous biosynthetic gene clusters However other factors such as chromosome compactization have been shown to have a significant influence on gene expression levels in bacteria and fungi The expression of genes and biosynthetic gene clusters may vary significantly depending on their location within the chromosome Little is known about the position effect in actinomycetes which are important producers of various industrially relevant bioactive molecules Results To demonstrate an impact of the chromosomal position effect on the heterologous expression of genes and gene clusters in Streptomyces albus J1074 a transposon mutant library with randomly distributed transposon that includes a Œ≤ glucuronidase reporter gene was generated Reporter gene expression levels have been shown to depend on the position on the chromosome Using a combination of the transposon system and a œÜC31 based vector the aranciamycin biosynthetic cluster was introduced randomly into the S albus genome The production levels of aranciamycin varied up to eightfold depending on the location of the gene cluster within the chromosome of S albus J1074 One of the isolated mutant strains with an artificially introduced attachment site produced approximately more aranciamycin than strains with endogenous attBs Conclusions In this study we demonstrate that expression of the reporter gene and aranciamycin biosynthetic cluster in Streptomyces albus J1074 varies up to eightfold depending on its position on the chromosome The integration of the heterologous cluster into different locations on the chromosome may significantly influence the titre of the produced substance This knowledge can be used for the more efficient engineering of Actinobacteria via the relocation of the biosynthetic gene clusters and insertion of additional copies of heterologous constructs in a suitable chromosomal position KeywordsStreptomyces albus J1074Heterologous expressionChromosomal position effectœÜC31

substantially to the discovery and characterisation of secondary metabolites The increase in the number of sequenced microbial genomes demonstrates that most of the biosynthetic clusters remain silent under standard laboratory conditions The expression of silent gene clusters in a well characterised heterologous host is a validated approach for the discovery of new natural products However insufficient yields of heterologously produced molecules often prevent their further purification and characterisation Currently several Streptomyces strains have been utilised as hosts for the production of natural products The most widely used are Streptomyces coelicolor Streptomyces avermitillis and Streptomyces albus J1074 However the production level of the heterologously produced compounds often needs to be further optimised Industrially relevant titres of some natural products may reach the multi gram per litre scale e g ‚â• g L erythromycin ‚â• g L tetracycline ‚â• g L salinomycin personal communication with Prof Hrvoje Petkovic Ljubljana University whereas the yields of natural products in heterologous hosts remain in the milligram range One of the factors significantly influencing the expression of genes and biosynthetic gene clusters is their location on the chromosome the so called chromosomal position effect This term describes differences in the expression of a gene depending on its chromosomal location Studies of gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae demonstrated that the expression of heterologous genes was repressed when integrated at silent loci indicating that repression occurred due to a positional effect In another study it was shown that an Aspergillus nidulans mutant defective in the system responsible for histone methylation activates silent secondary metabolite clusters The position effect can influence not only the expression level of a native gene after spontaneous translocations but also transgene expression after insertion into different regions of a genome leading to changes in heterologous production It was demonstrated that variations in Œ≤ galactosidase activity can reach fold in response to translocations of the Œ≤ galactosidase gene in the Escherichia coli chromosome However Schmid and Roth demonstrated only a threefold variation in the expression level of the his operon cluster randomly distributed within the Salmonella typhimurium chromosome Additionally Lactobacillus lactis mutants showed a threefold difference in the levels of gus a expression The main factors causing such variability in gene expression are i the level of DNA compactization ii variations in the promoter strength and iii the distance to the origin of replication The first two factors are more critical for eukaryotic organisms which have high levels of DNA compactization and greater variation in promoter strengths which may influence a downstream heterologous gene By contrast the distance to the replication origin is the major factor of variability in gene expression in prokaryotic cells because they contain a single origin of replication per genophore Thus a gene placed closer to the origin of replication is replicated before a gene located near the terminus and therefore has an operative increase in gene dosage Despite the importance of streptomycetes as producers of natural products the position effect has not yet been investigated in them The representatives of this genus have a complex life cycle These bacteria colonise the environment by growing branching multigenomic hyphae while simultaneously forming unigenomic spores to achieve dispersion Recent studies identified a novel protein specific to Actinobacteria that is responsible for DNA compactization chromosome segregation and antibiotic production In other studies a histone like protein was characterised that can structurally couple changes in DNA conformation and transcription in response to stress Such complexity in nucleoid organisation leads to variations in expression of different DNA regions and causes a chromosomal position effect However to date a lack of efficient tools for the exploration of streptomycetes genomics has limited any attempts to evaluate the impact of this factor on the expression of heterologous genes and clusters Here we extend previous studies on the chromosomal position effect to the mycelial microorganism Streptomyces albus J1074 which is a typical representative of the Streptomyces genus and is well known for its outstanding potential as a host for the heterologous production of bioactive small molecules During the past decade S albus J1074 has been used for the heterologous expression of various antibiotic biosynthetic clusters e g thiocoraline cyclooctatin and steffimycin Numerous genetic tools have recently been developed for the strain making its genome engineering rather straightforward To evaluate the impact of the chromosomal position effect on heterologous expression in the genome of S albus J1074 a transposon mutant library with randomly distributed gus a the Œ≤ glucuronidase reporter gene was generated The expression of the reporter gene in recombinant strains was analysed and various factors influencing the expression of the gusA gene are discussed In addition using a combination of a transposon system and the œÜC31 based vector the aranciamycin biosynthetic cluster was introduced randomly into the S albus genome Analysis of aranciamycin producers also demonstrated an eightfold variation in the production level of the antibiotic depending on its chromosomal location One of the isolated mutant strains with an artificially introduced attachment site produced more aranciamycin than strains with endogenous attBs Results and discussion Impact of the chromosomal position effect on gene expression To examine an impact of the chromosomal position effect on the expression of heterologous genes in S albus J1074 a transposon harbouring the reporter gene was constructed Fig The transposon contained the gus a reporter gene encoding Œ≤ glucuronidase under the control of the ermEp1 promoter The activity of Œ≤ glucuronidase can be spectrophotometrically measured The gus a gene is flanked by two fd phage terminators which prevent transcription in both directions with an efficiency of up to Additional file Figure S1 The apramycin resistance gene was cloned upstream and in the opposite direction to gus a to exclude any impact on expression of the reporter gene Then the transposon was cloned into the plasmid containing synthetic gene of Himar1 transposase and temperature sensitive pSG5 replicon The vector was introduced into genome S albus J1074 and library of transposon mutants was generated as described previously Eighteen mutants from this library with the randomly distributed reporter gene were isolated and analysed The insertions were mapped on the chromosome using rescue cloning as described elsewhere Table Fig All identified insertions were localised in a core region of the chromosome A measurement of the GusA activities was made after h of growth Table Fig The average value of activity was U mg and eight of the analysed mutants had activities that lay within this range mutants and Five mutants had activity values above average and another five mutants located mostly in the centre of the chromosome and had values below average The variation in the reporter gene expression was six fold the lowest value observed was U mg and the highest was U mg which was comparable to results described for other prokaryotes where two to threefold variations in activity have been observed Fig The map of the plasmid containing gus a in the transposon pALG Plasmids contains following features himar1 a

chromosome Owing to the isolation of gus a by the two terminators the activity of the local promoters should not have had a significant impact on its expression To confirm this the GusA activities of the mutants were compared with S albus J1074 RNA seq data after h of cultivation in liquid medium The RPKM reads per kilobase per million reads values of the genes which are located in the genome of S albus J1074 upstream and in the same orientation as gus a were analysed The results demonstrated that in the obtained transposon mutants local promoters had a minor effect on the level of gus a expression e g mutant which exhibited one of the lowest levels of GusA activity was flanked upstream by the region with a high RPKM value Fig Concurrently mutants with a relatively low RPKM of flanking genes e g mutants and were characterised by a high GusA activity level Fig Fig The comparison of GusA activity levels with expression level of adjacent genes correlation coefficient is equal Blue columns correspond to values of GusA activity Strains were grown for h at ¬∞C light grey columns correspond to RPKM after h of cultivation at ¬∞C Mutants are placed according to location of their transposons on the chromosome Chromosomal position effect does not correlate with distance to oriC Previous studies on the position effect in E coli and Salmonella demonstrated that variations in the expression level of reporter genes are caused mainly by gene dosage Unlike most bacteria that possess a circular chromosome streptomycetes carry a linear chromosome with a centrally located oriC Thus if the gene dosage plays a significant role in the expression level of heterologous genes the GusA activity in mutants with insertions localised closer to the chromosome centre should be higher than in those with insertions localised closer to the chromosome ends However plotting the GusA activities with positions of the reporter gene showed that mutants with integration near the oriC demonstrated GusA activity below average mutants and whereas strains with an insertion located some distance from the oriC closer to centres of the chromosomal shoulders demonstrated above average results mutants and Relocation of the site for gene cluster integration The obtained results demonstrated that the translocation of the heterologous construct may significantly influence its expression This result should also be valid for more complex genetic structures such as an antibiotic biosynthetic gene cluster It is difficult to deliver antibiotic biosynthetic gene clusters into a streptomycetes chromosome via a transposon due to their large size Most of the vectors carrying biosynthetic gene clusters are integrated into the chromosome via the phage œÜC31 integration system Thus we translocated the attB attachment site of œÜC31 into various locations of the S albus J1074 chromosome A transposon with an attachment site of the œÜC31 phage was constructed and cloned into a non replicative vector containing himar1 a the synthetic transposase gene The obtained plasmid pAHT Fig did not require any additional induction steps or curing of the plasmid backbone because the exconjugants obtained already contained a copy of the transposon inserted in the genome This vector was than introduced into S albus SAM3 ŒîattB ŒîpseB4 lacking both endogenous attB sites by intergeneric conjugation from E coli Fig The map of the plasmid containing phage attachment site in the transposon pAHT Plasmids contains following features himar1 a synthetic transposase gene under

site of œÜC31 phage The aranciamycin gene cluster was integrated into artificially distributed attBs This kb large cluster was isolated from Streptomyces echinatus and was previously expressed in different streptomycetes The cosmid with the aranciamycin cluster was introduced into twenty four transposon mutants In this way a library of strains carrying the aranciamycin biosynthetic cluster at different chromosomal positions was obtained As a control two strains containing naturally located attBs ŒîattB and ŒîpseB4 were used Altogether the mutants demonstrated an eightfold variation in aranciamycin production Such a variation in the expression level of a heterologous cluster correlated with results obtained for gus a gene expression described herein The average production of aranciamycin for the mutant strains was U mg However in this case we observed stronger variation in the results only one of the mutants produced in the range of ¬± mutant Thirteen mutants demonstrated below average results and mutants evinced above average results Fig The production of aranciamycin from four artificially integrated attBs was more than above the average production from endogenous attachment sites Fig mutants and The yield of aranciamycin in one of those mutants mutant was higher than in the control strains This result demonstrated that the translocation of the cluster may result in significant variation in antibiotic production Fig Relative concentration of aranciamycin in culture media of heterologous aranciamycin producers dattB S albus SAM1 ŒîattB p412C06 dpseB4 S

to average production of aranciamycin by control strains with one integration site Strains were grown for h at ¬∞C Relative concentration of aranciamycin was calculated as peak area per gram of dry mass These data suggest that the central regions of the chromosomal shoulders are more preferable loci for the expression of heterologous constructs because GusA activity in mutants with these integrations was higher than average Given that streptomycetes are well established cell factories for the biosynthesis of natural products it is important to study the influence of chromosomal localisation on the expression of biosynthetic gene clusters Indeed the eightfold variation in antibiotic production was observed in the library of mutants carrying corresponding gene clusters in different locations of the chromosome Four of the isolated mutants demonstrated more than a increase in antibiotic production and one of these mutants showed a increase in the yield of aranciamycin U mg compared with the average production of the control strains U mg Thus the proposed approach can be used in combination with other methods that are employed for the optimisation of the heterologous production of natural products This approach can be used not only for translocation of the attachment site but also to introduce additional integration sites into the genome thus resulting in an increase in the number of clusters per genome We believe that the genetic tools described herein will find wide applications in the construction and manipulation of actinobacterial heterologous hosts Conclusions Our study demonstrates the effect of the chromosomal position effect on a heterologously expressed reporter gene and on more complex genetic constructs such as antibiotic biosynthetic gene clusters in S albus J1074 Based on this phenomenon we developed an approach that can be used for the construction of host strains with improved heterologous production features Methods Bacterial

I myself personally watched it because of all the hype around it then. I'll also want to add that DEEN/Stay Night was not considered bad. The ""fakers"" only considered it bad because they now have ufotable's overrated works to compare it to. But back when it was the only animated series, alot of people considered it awesome enough to actually acknowledge it as a decent intro to Fate, despite some complains. For perspective sake, Shingetsutan Tsukihime did not get this treatment. Hell, I heard DEEN/Stay Night even introduced Kansho and Byakuya OverEdge, which was NEVER used in the original VN and Type-Moon themselves acknowledged as awesome enough to introduce it in canon. Well the biggest complaints about it these days is that it ""blends all the routes"". Having rewatched it a few months back literally all there is from Unlimited Blade Works is Archer using Unlimited Blade Works against Herc and Saber's fight with assassin and Shirou and Rin vs. Caster and Soichiro. They just get bailed out by Gil instead of Archer. Then from Heaven's Feel they have the Tohsaka sisters reveal and vague references to dark Sakura. Considering they probably expected the anime and the UBW movie to be the end of animated Fate works they put those references in to nod at the routes. Speaking of the movie it totally has the better Shirou vs. Archer fight. Also the original has the most Saber and more Saber is good."

2560,2560,Honestly every girl can look good in a üëô you just need to have the confidence to not care what other people think I used to be the one at the pool party fully clothed because I did not want anyone to see my body If someone asked Why are not you going in the pool I d say I was on my period and did not feel good And it s not like that was even that long ago that was in college Accepting my body for the way it looks is something I am working on daily I love my body for what it can do It s strong It s magnificent It s unstoppable But when I focus on just the physical that s when things get skewed out of perspective So guys today when you look in the mirror point out ALL the things you LOVE about the way you look All of them Appreciate them Be grateful for them Then point out one thing you do not like Yes I want you to do that too because I want you to be raw real and honest with yourself Once you point it out you must do of things Make a plan to change it or Learn to accept it What you cannot do is complain about it This life is yours to make amazing You hold the power You are not the victim

6653,6653,So it s been such a long time since I wrote on here and gosh I have missed it Being not able to leave the house has made me take up quite a few old hobbies again lately and writing on this blog was one that I really wanted to do I must admit that I have not done much on the beauty front for a while and stopped buying a lot of things We recently moved house and the effort and money that went into that whole ordeal took a lot out of me Just when I felt like things were starting to calm down again this whole COVID thing took hold and our world was turned into a crazy juggle I now have to run my business full time from home something I have done for almost years while trying to home school my son at the same time and the struggle is very real My husband is also working full time from home now and the lack of space that I used to have is becoming a bit of a problem I am an introvert by nature so the fact that I can not go out and do much because of this whole self isolating thing is not that big a deal for me but the fact that I have lost a lot of my own quiet time at home that I used to get while everyone else was out is something that I am struggling to deal with I also lost a lot of my makeup mojo too which has made me a bit sad A little while ago my year old daughter flooded our ensuite sink because she left the plug in with the tap running which ended up flooding the whole vanity around it and in turn took all my makeup palettes for a big swim see below photo After this happened I ended up having to throw out some of my most prized and favourite palettes which was totally devastating I tried drying them all out as best I could but all of the ones that were in cardboard packaging ended up going mouldy after a few days and just could not be saved I had to say goodbye to all of my Kat Von D palettes my The Balm palettes one of my Rimmel Katy Kat palettes plus a couple of others and it was so upsetting Especially when some of them are not available to buy anymore View this post on Instagram That time when your year old leaves the ensuite tap running with the plug in for an undetermined amount of time and you find the entire room flooded and your eyeshadow palettes all drowning in a cm pool of water inside the box they live in next to the sink This is post cleanup and hopefully the ones I can save if they dry out enough Thankfully the rest of my makeup collection was in a sealed plastic drawer tray unscathed but some palettes were totally ruined üò¢üò¢ü§¨ü§¨A post shared by Michelle Doorey on Oct at am PDT I have also developed a new love for essential oils lately I have been making a heap of my own diffuser blends which I am loving and have started making my own beauty products as well I have also been trying to use a mix on my hair to see if I can get it to grow back the way it used to be prior to having kids and I do feel that it is making a bit of a difference especially to the amount of hair that I have been losing each day I have so many little short and fluffy hairs growing at the front of my hairline and throughout my hair these days which is making me quite excited as I was terrified that I was going to be bald in a couple of years with how thin it was starting to get What has everyone else been doing lately I must admit I have been on a bit of an online shopping spree the last couple of days which has made me feel a bit happier and almost normal I have lived in nothing but active wear for almost a month since moving and being stuck at home so it was nice to buy some new clothes and eagerly await for them to get delivered I have decided that even if I am not going anywhere and no one is going to see me I am still going to try to go back to making an effort clothes and makeup wise just to feel kind of normal again Anyway I d love to know about any new products anyone has been using and enjoying lately or any new hobbies or things that you have learnt since being stuck at home during these crazy times I am going to attempt to make a real effort to update this blog a bit more even if it s not all about makeup these days as it feels nice to just write my thoughts and feelings down again Stay safe everyone Michelle xx

7835,7835,"i guess you dont miss the time when games are non-political. its looks like you miss the time when you dont need to care about politics yeah recently lot of game have some problem with political-correct or sjw thing( ) and i also 100% agree with your oppinion that game dont need to be political because games are not textbook or something but atleast that political-correct background story or features dosen't affect play exprience, i think it should be fine. look at the Gibralter and Bloodhound from Apex Legend. they're lgbtq. when people heard that at first time, yeah they(and also me) think this is kind of sjw thing gonna happen again. but now no one complain about that becasue they are lgbt or not, game is still great and fun lgbt flag in A Hat in Time is really small thing (honestly i play that game over 60 hour but never know until see this post) change color feature in Soul Caliber 6 is not necessary. it's for lot of type of people and no one push you to using it. if you dont want your female charater turn into yellow or black(or maybe blueberry purple or mint green), just setting it as normal. that's all i dont want games ruined by to much politically-correct thing(guess every gamer have same opinion) but also i dont want great games be underrated because of politically-correct thing please let me know your thinking about my opinion. i hope make this post for good place to conversation."
4299,4299,DIGIMON INVISIBLE WAR GAMES Episode First Contact The Digi Enevits Portal Screenwriter s Digimon Sommelier Network Syndicated Narrator Tai Kamiya It was all a fog Just a huge blur of fierce fighting that s broken out inside of the Digital World None of us could ve expected all that s happening there right now I suppose I should start from the beginning and explain how I got sucked into this mess HEIGHTON VIEW TERRACE UNIVERSITY COMPUTER LAB AFTERNOON Wearing his signature goggles pushed up on his head of sprung out brown hair Tai enters a computer lab at his school wearing his green university blazer with khakis By a flat screened computer a matured Izzy types away at the third draft of a final exam to be taken by his class a week from then Narrator Tai I was visiting Izzy in the computer lab about to ask him for help on some research paper I was sure I was gonna fail I mean this coming from a kid who mostly climbed trees and napped for most of his early academic years At first we were just having a casual conversation but things got weird after a while Let me show you Izzy Still typing on a black keyboard he turns in his seat to see Tai Oh hey Tai What s going on Tai What s up Izzy Do you feel up for helping me ace my research paper that s due this Izzy Brows arch as he gives him a serious expression Sorry no can do Tai I m currently preoccupied with this monster draft for Tai For that boring final you re supposed to be taking next Friday Awesome Lame stuff to pass the time Izzy Joke all you want Tai but I m gonna keep my perfect track record of getting stellar grades I m already in line to be in the Omicron Society Tai Gasps Omicron Man you re gonna go under when they tell you what you have to do to get into their House Izzy You place little faith in me Tai I m disappointed I m well aware of what their hazing process is like and I m ready Tai Are you sure Izzy Those guys put dirty socks soaked by rain in the pages of your notebooks and leave em there And that s just the tip of the iceberg Suddenly Tai and Izzy hear a slight explosion They run to the large windows at the end of the computer room Izzy Wide eyed a sweat drop falls down his face What was that Tai Dunno but it was way loud Could it be coming from the houses across the street from campus Izzy Fingers thrumming against his chin he contemplates No way this is a peaceful neighborhood Maybe we should go check it out Tai Right now Izzy I ve gotta be studying Izzy I d hardly call coming in here to get me to write a whole research paper for you as hitting the books Tai Perhaps you should run that by Kari and see if she d be willing to oblige you Tai Hey leave my little sister out of this They then hear another thunderous loud bang from outside Tai Gasps once more Huh There it goes again Izzy Looks out at the lush forestry down below and the places nearby It s impossible that it could be coming from this vicinity All the buildings are in plain view and there doesn t seem to be any commotion arising from them Worried look in his glimmering eyes It s got to be Tai No you don t think Balls fist If this noise is coming from out of our atmosphere then something s gotta be happening in the Digital World Izzy Still concerned as he looks out the window An invisible spot But that would mean that the Digital World is a lot closer to Earth than we originally thought Gasps Maybe there are some areas of the Digi World right here on Earth and we just can t see them Tai do you know what this means Tai Unreal You could be onto something Izzy That brain of yours is like some kind of mushy laptop that never turns off Izzy Pay attention Tai It appears that there s a bigger threat to the Digi World than we previously gathered If there are invisible spots within the Digital World that we had no knowledge of then that means that there are also many new species of Tai Leans back his face mingled with intrigue Uh Digimon More shock sets in And if there s trouble afoot that also means that there might be new Digidestined about to be chosen Another boom ensues but this time the trees outside shake their glossy leaves rustling Izzy Whoa It sounds like a war is going on there What do we do Tai He pulls out his Digivice a portable hexagonal device used in his younger years from his pocket It s off its tiny screen inactive He stares at it confused Nothing Whoever s about to get a new Digivice like Davis and the others did a few years ago they need to handle this difficult new threat not us No matter how many new kids there are this is their new adventure to embark upon Balls fist closing it on his Digivice and looks out at the setting sun Their Invisible War Game Izzy nods agreeing Then the computer behind them starts going haywire Various data codes millions of numbers on its screen cascade down in a quick pattern Izzy Oh no my draft Tai He drops his blank papers in his hand and they drift to the solid floor of the lab He is in awe Forget a draft Iz What the heck is going on over there Your computer it s bugging out Suddenly a long beam shoots out from the evening sun flies through the open window and connects with the computer screen The stretched beam rises forming a wall of light with Tai and Izzy on either side It is honey colored and they can see one another from where each of them is standing In Tai s hand and from inside Izzy s pocket the original Digivices start shining unexpectedly Tai Whoa Izzy They re they re changing Tai Quick hurry Hold your Digivice up to the wall of light A tense Izzy lifts his heavily shining Digivice up to the wall of light slowly rising up to their shoulders Tai does the same with his determinedly holding his up on the other side Their old Digivices keep shining Suddenly they suck up the vast wall of light and begin morphing When all the light has been absorbed they become strange hand held oval devices with wavy designs Tai s red and Izzy s dark orange Tai Confounded glancing at his Digivice s altered form Huggh What re these things Mysterious Human Voice Invisible to both of them They re called D Spectrums and you two have been called upon once again to join a new team of vigilantes who will safeguard the Digital World Do your best to restore peace to our ever growing universe protect us Digi Inevits Tai and Izzy exchange stupefied looks unable to verbalize how stunned they are The two D Spectrums the college boys hold light up A moment later the large window in the lab opens wide and the new Digivices drag the boys out of it sending them flying Both As they re driven through the air fearfully holding onto their D Spectrums Wraaggh The D Spectrums pull them through midair before they become two large comets of red and orange light that intertwine endlessly while travelling straight into an invisible spot over the sunset Season Opening Song Invisible War Games by Matsuda Noe fictional Commercials Toonzai VO We re back With a super new season of Digimon Right here on Toonzai THE DIGITAL WORLD BOREALIS MEADOW DAY Falling from the sky Tai and Izzy land with a thud in an unfamiliar meadow Both Disoriented on the grassy ground Uggh Just then something heavy falls right on top of them Tai Feels its hard impact on his back W uggh Izzy Did ya have to bring your computer with you too Izzy I didn t bring a computer with me Tai and last I checked computers don t move Tai What Nestled between the two new Digi Inevits is a grey bundle of clothes It rolls over to reveal a little boy with springy sky blue hair Tai and Izzy return to their feet to see the boy laughing wildly in the grass The boy jumps up He balls an excited fist Boy With a bright smile that reveals braces he greets the two humans Hiya Tai and Izzy G uhh Tai Who re you kid Boy My name s Yibui And I m a Digi Inevit from Kyoto Tai Uh Digi Izzy Stunned Inevit Yibui Yeah Are you two Digi Inevits too Cool Welcome to the Digital World you two Tai Face to face with the smaller Yibui Uhm we ve heard of it Rubs semi numb cheek Hey how old are you kid Yibui Nine Izzy Well then what are you doing here Yibui Yibui I m here to stop the Digimon War Demons from destroying the Digital World and all the precious Digimon that inhabit this beautiful place Tiny Voice from Nowhere Yeah and I promise to help out too Suddenly the three boys are met by a teeny female Digimon with a witch s cloak and hat her long blonde hair sticking out She bounces her little body over to the boys Tai Gasps Whoa Junior Wizardmon alert Tiny Witch Digimon No I m Gabbymon Pleased to meet you I m been wondering where the rest of the Digi Inevits were For a while I thought Yibui and I were among the only ones here It s real pleasant of you two to come join the fight I m extremely excited for us to set off on such an exhilarating and Izzy As the miniscule Digimon keeps talking he turns to Tai muttering I see why her name is Gabbymon now I m guessing she can talk a brick wall to pieces Tai points Izzy winces as they see Gabbymon s pouty red face She is upset by Izzy s insult Yibui Never tell Gabby she talks too much She gets quiet and builds up anger after which she just attacks you without warning Tai Picks up little Gabbymon causing her to give a confused look Hey Gabbymon Izzy didn t mean it But you can t deny though you ve way social for a Digimon Gabbymon breathes fire in Tai s face charring it Tai Feeling the attack s fiery effects Whaaah Gabbymon bounces to the meadow ground and storms over to Yibui s leg Izzy To Yibui So is Gabbymon your Digimon partner Yibui Yibui Oh no I d never get any sleep Gabbymon s tiny forehead turns purple Infuriated she runs through the meadow to blow off steam My Digimon is right over there Tai and Izzy see a weasel type Rookie level Digimon with a small pot on its head petting a small group of Rhinodramon a never before seen species of rhino Digimon that have coats of purple armor Yibui To his partner Hey bud come meet the new additions Tai A little offended New additions Balls fist at Yibui I was saving the Digital World before you were even thought of kid Yibui s weasel type Digimon turns to see Tai and Izzy and then smiles He hurries over Yibui s Digimon Speaks with a proud rasp Hey how s it going new guys I m Potsumon a Rookie level Tai Thoughts Only VO Weird they think we re new blood here To Izzy Izzy when we were shot past the Digital World s barrier do ya think we were sent straight into an invisible spot like you were talking about Izzy My estimation is you re right To Yibui Yibui is this meadow invisible by any chance Yibui Only for those who haven t been here If you re being literal though nope This meadow s still very much a visible part of the Digi World Tai But are there invisible areas in the Digi World Yibui Of course They re in trouble right now but the invisible regions are real as a matter of fact Izzy Excited to hear more from Yibui Great Now how do we get there Potsumon Looks up at human partner Show em Yibui Tai As puzzled as Izzy is he questions Yibui Eh what s he talkin about Yibui Giggles at the college boys in View Terrace blazers I ll show ya Yibui pulls out a light green D Spectrum of his own and lifts it toward the opposite direction facing the sky The new Digivice s inactive screen flashes on ominously Falling in a circle a few holes dent the screen with a loud noise before the holes begin glowing Tai and Izzy gasp as the sky changes to show a new region where it s evening and within which there are churches and towers standing tall Tai What is that Gabbymon Bounces back to them her giddy mood fully returned It s Afterhours City A War Demon Digimon controls it Tai Points his face full of surprise Hey look Within the dark and quiet new region as seen from the sky the three Digi Inevits can see Agumon by a trash bin by a large silver church talking to Tentomon whose wings are buzzing animatedly near him Izzy Prodigious Tai It s Agumon Izzy And Tentomon But but but what are they doing in an invisible city for goodness sake Yibui They were sucked there of course Are those your Digimon Tai A drop of sweat on his face he gives Izzy a blank stare This guy is seriously way too young to know our story Well to be brutally honest it was quite a long time ago Izzy Yeah no kidding To Yibui whose D Spectrum is showing them Afterhours City Yibui can our D Spectrums take us to this strange city in the air Yibui Uh huh Tai Withdraws his D Spectrum Then let s stop all this chattering and get this show on the road Izzy Holding little Gabbymon who s sprouted tears in his arms Jeez Tai could you be more insensitive Tai Unseen by camera Sorry Junior Wizardmon Almost forgot you were still around us Potsumon To Yibui Tell them the passage words Yibui Yibui I m way ahead of you Potsumon To Tai and Izzy If you really want to get into each of the invisible spots you ve got to say Invisible Portal Digi tize Izzy exchanges a brave nod with Tai before whipping his dark orange D Spectrum forward Tai does the same with his red Digivice a courageous expression on his face Tai Man I just hope someone else we know will be waiting on us when we get there Standing by their side Yibui nods too pointing his light green D Spectrum at the sky with the other two Digi Inevits MULTIPLE SCREENS Tai Izzy and Yibui s contorted faces as they summon the portal Digi Inevits INVISIBLE PORTAL DIGI TIZE The D Spectrums release bright lights in their respective colors over each Digi Inevit The lights shoot up spiral up to the sky with the heroes and their companions in it heading towards the invisible city seen high up They successfully enter THE DIGITAL WORLD INVISIBLE SPOT AFTERHOURS CITY In the empty street Tai and Izzy rush over and reunite with their Digimon partners Agumon and Gabumon Tai Holds Agumon Agumon Izzy Kneels and holds Tentomon s pincers Tentomon You ve grown Tentomon Don t be silly Izzy It s only a couple of pounds Izzy chuckles at him Holding little Gabbymon in his arms Yibui and his Rookie level Potsumon beam at the more experienced Digi Inevits interacting with their partners Gabbymon To Yibui This city is swarming with dark Digimon of all shapes and sizes I wonder if the resident Digimon War Demon is close by Yibui Probably so Gabbymon but we ve got stronger ammunition now Clenches fist Because two new Digi Inevits just dropped by to join our team Tai Narrows eyes at the kid Yeah about that Yibui I m usually the leader when it comes to these things so if ya don t mind I d like to be the gogglehead taking charge from this point on Are you alright with that Yibui Sure I don t have a problem stepping back a bit and letting an amateur Digi Inevit run things for a change Tai Izzy gapes at Yibui along with him Amateur Someone else laughs The talkative Gabbymon leaps from Yibui s arms She runs along the cobblestone ground to greet her human partner Ken Ichijouji Holds his tiny witch Digimon s sides with his hands Why hello there It s nice to see you again Gabbymon CLOSE UP Tai and Izzy are both confounded Tai To Ken Ken What re you doing here in the Digital World An invisible spot no less Izzy Stunned expression Yeah and how on Digi earth did you get another Digimon partner Ken Friendly smirk Oh I still only have one Tai What s that s posed to mean Ken pulls out a green D Spectrum formerly his old Digivice Gabbymon stands by his side with a curious look to the others ahead of them Ken Fierce look as he holds his D Spectrum Gabbymon ROOKIE DIGIVOLVE The green D Spectrum shines brightly Rookie Digivolution Sequence Bouncing straight from a platform suspended sideways in the air Gabby goes floating through a circular hoop of hundreds of green data codes Gabbymon Now on a turning hexagon platform with her name and codes spiraling around her wee body Gabbymon Rookie Digivolve to Light envelops her her shape is altered As the light diminishes Wormmon appears on the platform WORMMON Ken picks his freshly returned Wormmon up from the ground Izzy In a startled state That s incredible You turned your Rookie level into another one How is it possible Ken Holding Wormmon Pretty impressive Izzy don t you think You see Gabbymon is a part of a new generation of Digimon species that exclusively inhabit the invisible regions You see she s an Invisible Rookie You won t be able tofind er anywhere else Pretty cool huh Tai That s an understatement With that new Digivice you ve acquired you just defied the laws of the outer Digital World Wormmon To Ken I need a nap Ken I don t think I got enough beauty rest Can I curl up like a kitty now and go off to sleep I think Gabbymon needs tons more conversations with you Ken laughs boyishly Izzy Spellbound This is unnatural I don t believe this He turns to Tai Tai if what we saw Ken just demonstrate with his D Spectrum is any indication then there s a high likelihood that we can turn our Rookies into new ones too Yibui Well there s the problem right there So far Mr Ken seems to be the only one capable of doing it My D Spectrum can t make Potsumon cross Rookie stages I guess Mr Ken s D Spectrum is a lot different than ours Tai In a huff Whadd ya mean I just can t stand here and let another Digi Inevit have a better D Spectrum than me To Ken Grrh cough it up already Ken Yibui was just joking guys Every D Spectrum can change a Rookie into a never before seen species of one Tentomon Of course they re never before seen We re in an invisible city hidden from the rest of society Agumon His open mouth suddenly widens PEPPER BREATH He releases a round purple fireball that chars the side of a grey building Izzy takes notice Tai Hey Agumon why d you do that Agumon Someone s spying on us It had large ears and a really overweight shadow Gatomon springs from behind the building and mewls while springing at Agumon Gatomon I ll show you who s packing microwavable meals extinct dino wreck Hurrying from the looming building Kari newly long haired catches Gatomon before she bludgeons a surprised Agumon Kari Gatomon take a breather Agumon was only describing your shadow Gatomon calms down She walks over to Agumon and pats him on the arm Gatomon To him Sorry for the surprise ambush and the crazy outburst I ve been a little testy lately with the Digimon War Demons controlling everything Agumon You I toss and turn every night just thinking about it Tai runs and grabs Kari into a giant bear hug Tai Kari You re here Kari Oh hey there Tai Leans back slightly to look at her older brother Yep I m invisible now just like the rest of you guys Ken Hey Kari could I see what your D Spectrum looks like Kari Sure Ken you can take a look She holds up a hot pink one for all to see I m super content with mine It s almost like it was custom made for me Gatomon Her green gloves up Now it s time to Rookie Digivolve Kari Not quite yet Gatomon Winks at her You can change into your Invisible Rookie form Cleopatramon later Is that reasonable Gatomon Amped up Whenever you re ready Kari I ve got some ideas for those Digimon War Demons that they won t like any better than a day in my litter box A soaring blast of white hot light suddenly knocks the group of Digi Inevits to the ground The kids are all on their knees with their Digimon partners An evil Digimon War Demon s voice thunders down on them from high above Afterhours City DIGIMON WAR DEMON VO Laughs chidingly You foolish Digi Inevits have entered the worst nightmare imaginable The Digimon War Demons will destroy the Digital World piece by piece starting with every single one of the invisible regions we find Surely if you attempt to meddle in our plans we will make certain that your deaths are inevitable Shaking on the ground the Digi Inevits grind their teeth with a mixture of fear and fury on their faces Izzy Grits teeth fighting his intense emotions Just who is that guy Ken On all fours tending to Wormmon who received a minor hit by the unexpected blast The Digimon War Demon that rules this very city Tai So that means Eyes flash open The brutal Invisible War Games are underway FADE

2590,2590,"I don¬ít think that what Stevie said recently was very political. She talked about liking Hillary Clinton in the last election because they were around the same age and she¬íd met her personally. She has also said that she and Lindsey were hippie kids in describing their liberal views. IIRC Lindsey even hosted a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton in 2016. And I believe it¬ís been said that John (?) didn¬ít want to perform at the Clinton inauguration because he held opposing views. In context, she only brings up politics when someone asks her a political question or something touches her heartstrings (ie her work with Walter Reed, 9/11, New Orleans, etc). Even in those instances, it¬ís more about the issues than the politics. Right now, Covid seems to be that issue. Like us, she¬ís stuck in her house and wants to go back to normal life. I don¬ít think mourning the loss of Ruth Bader Ginsberg is extremely political either. Stevie was not disparaging RBG¬ís replacement or talking about rights being under fire. She essentially just said ¬ìRIP.¬î Dolly Parton did the same thing. Women of a certain age directly benefited from RBG¬ís fight for gender equality, even before she was a Supreme Court justice. Last I knew, Martin Luther King Jr. was an American ¬ís ¬ís turned into an activist overnight here! __________________"

1131,1131,"Quote from: Eddyc on September 19, 2018, 08:28:14 PM Is there an alternative way to attract investors beyond the technical aspects? I would like someone to answer this question and discuss the issue. Not on current evidence, no. The ""technical aspects"" are the only aspects of an altcoin clone that are objectively (or near offer) available to investors for informing their assessessment of the potential ROI. However, to use the term ""investment"" in the context of swapping tokens of a clone of Bitcoin for bankable fiat is stretching the semantics of the term well beyond its breaking point. If the reality of the context were to be honestly acknowledged, then a far more accurately descriptive term would be ""speculation"". (for Google translate: use your common sense, it's not ""investment"" but ""speculation"") There is no point in trying to discuss psychological matters (such as ""appeal"") on bitcointalk but I have rounded up some of my observations in a single post a different perspective on cryptocurrency. For background, I'm a cognitive scientist currently engaged in investigating the informational requirements of the typical tasks performed by an online collective intelligence and, for me, the technical aspects are more pertinently addressed elsewhere, including for example the psychology of money and the empirical work (open access) done by Kathleen Vohs and collaborators, for one: ""No Match for Money: Even in Intimate Relationships and Collectivistic Cultures, Reminders of Money Weaken Sociomoral Responses,"" ""Money Cues Increase Agency and Decrease Prosociality Among Children: Early Signs of Market-Mode Behaviors,"" ""Money Priming Can Change People¬ís Thoughts, Feelings, Motivations, and Behaviors: An Update on 10 Years of Experiments,"""

it Becky McIntyre No I think he does what a lot of young people do gets it from home only in this case home is back in Chicago home of a famous crime family the head of it being his uncle Carl Carl Ludwig Becky McIntyre Becky has slipped out of the ropes that bound her Tada H M Murdock How did you do that Becky McIntyre We used to do it all the time when I worked for Morty the Magnificent The trick is in flexing your wrist when the guy from the audience is tying you up We used to practise it all the time Morty loved to tie me up H M Murdock I bet he did Murdock Becks do not you think it s a bit of a mistake to let Face stay in there with Katrina I mean is not that like giving the henhouse keys to the fox Becky McIntyre Captain we must all deal with our own weaknesses Murdock Ah yes the

hate guilt Benny Conway But we are winning Their case is shot full of holes and once Colonel Quyet testifies it will be shot down entirely Becky McIntyre Uh would you mind not using words like full of holes shot down I mean it conjures up such a negative image Face Colonel Morrison an NVA agent I just can not believe it Hannibal Seems to be true Face Even so surely the court would need more than

unpleasant experience B A Baracus You think Murdock coulda killed Colonel Morrison Becky McIntyre That s impossible Hannibal If you found out Morrison was working for the Viet Cong what would you have done Hannibal Well how long do we have to let you know I mean before you get us out Gen Hunt Stockwell Colonel That s not part of the deal I can not get you out B A Say what Becky McIntyre Wait a minute what do you mean you can not get us out of here Gen Hunt Stockwell Well I could not assist three federal prisoners convicted of murder in escaping Contact me upon your successful evasion of your current situation Then we have a deal Becky McIntyre If Murdock gets us out of this as far as I am concerned he can have anything he wants as long as I live B A I do not know I gotta think about this the A Team is assigned to infiltrate foreign territory Carla As Americans you can expect to be shot on sight if you are discovered Frankie Dishpan Santana Well how do they feel about Puerto Ricans B A Baracus And black people Becky McIntyre And the Irish Faceman We have done everything that Stockwell has asked and he s never so much as even said thank you We have even saved the guys life As long as we keep succeding in these missions he s gonna keep us around for more and a soon as we start fail well we are dead B A Baracus That s a good point Faceman I am telling you Stockwell has taken over our lives He s even started taking over my dreams Becky McIntyre Can he do that Murdock Murdock thinks he s got radioactive poisoning That flower where I touched it it s turned brown I

2713,2713,p s the regular warning of prepare for a wall of text p p s bruh if you are expecting a TL DR then you are reading the wrong person s guides no way i can tl dr this P P P S if i forget something i will add it in today so expect this guide to get even longer edit eyyy i won i started writing this before they announced that lol Since i recently saw that one of my guides was being voted for most helpful post of the year and a whole bunch of players sent me thank you messages for helping them climb like mmr in just a couple of weeks with that guide So i figured i d start making guides again Some people asked me to start streaming i would like to but my internet connection is simply way too unstable for that right now My internet connection drops more times a day than a hooker drops pants So if anyone would like to help me out by getting some coaching from me so i can get a better computer and internet connection so i can start streaming So let us talk about analysing replays First a little bit of a back story Back in the ye olde days of the k mmr trench after my friend quit dota i wanted to escape it and have actually enjoyable matches for once But i had a big problem How on earth do i win how do i get good I obviously would not be able to afford coaching and there were not that many good guides nor did i know if the guides were made by k players or k+ players so i could literally learn nothing from a guide or even learn to play wrong As i have seen this happen to like of my students where they would simply follow a bad low mmr meta or read guides by low players who have nothing to show for it like people who have matches on a hero but have not moved an inch from k would make a horrible guide that they d sell off as experienced player + pudge matches never miss a hook again Now i am not saying that someone who s k mmr will magically be able to make good guides but even a bad guide from that player is still x better than a deceiving guide from a low player who has nothing to show for it I have seen some good guides by low players who grinded mmr and then shared their findings even if it comes obvious to you it could be quite helpful to someone else If you are reading a guide make sure that you understand where it came from So then i started analyzing replays as it was simply the only thing i could do and then i figured out holy shit this is x faster than reading guides So here s how i analyzed replays First you d ask yourself how do you want to go up do you want to carry support roam etc This is quite important because you are gonna try to specialize that role Lots of people do not want to play every single role but for the sake of saving your own brain from exploding if you are like that just learn one role first then work from there on on the others Make sure that whatever you chose is enjoyable to play i chose sandking because the hero is unique and also since i had fps and ping i could always rely on my combo with shift queue to win a fight even if my dota is like a slideshow IT s also quite fun to run around the map and never get killed because of the escape mechanisms SK has Like the guides you gotta find a good source of knowledge You gotta find a high mmr player who plays your hero role of choice and does it constantly and consistently Best way to find them is dotabuff and opendota rankings You can also look on dotamastery io for other players as the dotabuff opendota rankings sometimes behave weird and put k in top instead of ks IMO opendota dotabuff should change their top rankings to only include players with divine and up But if you actually ask me the best people you can learn from are BOOSTERS SMURFS Because there simply will be a lot of things that are BRACKET dependent but i will not post those here for example you could give me games to analyse with the exact same heroes but one in k and other in k and i would tell you to do the exact opposite things to win that match example in k mmr you can not solo farm and push the whole game you d lose because of your team losing v5 but opposite in k you literally want to solo farm and splitpush the whole game because if you join a fight you probably lose it not because you are bad but because your teammates are So later on you are checking your replay theorizing on what target you went on or how you missed a spell or how you went too early too late but in reality none of that mattered because you should not have been there in the first place and this is why boosters smurfs are so efficient to learn from because you can find exactly what you need for YOUR bracket because their games are usually the cleanest and most efficient stomps you can find those replays tell you EXACTLY what you need to do to win I know people hate boosting smurfing but I have learned x more things from watching smurfs than from watching pros So if you have any high mmr friends who smurf boost ask them to show you their accounts Also very good to find interactive and educational streamers also obviously make sure you are watching them for educational purpose same way that sitting at home drinking beer watching basketball will not make you LeBron same way watching RTZ and typing CS LUL every time he misses a LH will not make you good at dota So let us say you found your source of knowledge whatever it may be It s time to start decoding their playstyle be warned this whole analysis process is gonna take you + replays to fully understand someone So let us lay out some goals to help us with our progress understanding of basic patterns macro game early macro game midgame macro game lategame micro game early micro game midgame micro game lategame game specific + total prediction rate The whole point of the analysis and the end goal is to be able to predict the person s moves ahead of time The only way you can make accurate and precise predictions is if you are thinking like him and at that point you will have the tool set necessary to be able to grind mmr up to near his level So if you do a proper complete analysis you will be grinding or even more mmr a month But before you do that you need to know about important things that might prevent you from increasing in mmr which you need to look after Mentality it is the most obvious thing this process of analysing takes time and it is not easy One thing that i learned is to forget about the mmr and think only about the knowledge as i knew if i can learn to play like this no matter how bad my teammates i will grind up sooner or later I d also highly recommend to check out this guide give your struggling PMA attitude a with AMP Adaptive Mental Posture It is quite amazing for helping you get to enjoy your games more stages of competence This comes with things st is that you will be playing some games in parallel to analyzing and you have to understand that you will simply fail some things as you are not competent at them So if you mess up you should always consider how competent you are at that thing to figure out if it was just a mechanical mess up like a missed hook or if it was a wrong decision like you should have been in another lane Now the nd thing is the fact that gameplay is very bracket dependant look at that stages of competence chart the problem is not going from to it can be going from to again Since a lot of things are bracket dependent you will learn things that are simply WRONG in the next bracket but work in the previous these are the mistakes that will stop you from improving It is way harder to fix a bad habbit than to learn a new one make sure to spot your bad habits as early as possible by comparing your replays to the person you are analyzing Plateau as i also like to call it floating like a boat on water the water brings it up and down a bit but it never flies off nor sinks When you have hit a plateau you are going up and down by like but you are not increasing nor decreasing in mmr over time like matches it s time to learn something new whatever knowledge you have so far brought you here but improving it too much will not bring you further very efficiently Best thing you could do here is find a new topic or a new hero player role to analyse For example i got to k with SK jungle but i wasn t getting up anymore no matter how much i got better at it then i started doing sky lich and cm and skyrocketed to k in literally no time Precision and accuracy like the image shows when you make predictions you gotta make precise AND accurate statements For example i could be watching a k play Mid and i could make a higly accurate prediction and say he s gonna go gank now but i did not say where is he gonna go gank and what player But i could also make a highly precise prediction and say he s gonna go to the bot lane but i did not say what he s gonna do there is he gonna farm is he gonna push is he gonna teamfight The proper statement would be he s gonna teleport to the bot lane then kill their slark with his dagon + silence combo And this is what i mean with the end goal of + total prediciton rate Variance It is things that you simply can not control like teammates misplays feeding internet connection etc It is not always possible to control everything that s why sometimes even k smurfs will lose in k If you can not find a solution to a problem using whatever possible method the LAST thing that you can do is simply say that it falls under variance and that it is something that is simply not possible to control So Let us start with the analysis itself for this we are actually gonna need an example player so for this i will take this guy as he s got a nice clinkerz stomp rate on a k smurf so this should be good The method is split into parts first you analyse but then you start predicting to confirm disconfirm your theories Sometimes you can give an explanation that sounds correct but actually is completely off Why did Bob drink the juice and not the milk Well you could say he just likes juice that might be true but there is also a possibility that he s lactose intolerant so let us start with Understanding of basic patterns this usually takes replays and is the easiest part What we are looking at here is the most generalized things about his gameplay common item build lane overall plan to win the game Aka what repeats every game as this is simply the base of the gameplay example this guy goes mid the items he buys are aquila> soul ring> brown boots> medalion> deso> treads> hex he usually goes mid but if someone takes it then he goes safelane He spends the early game in the lane and after he gets level he starts eating the hard camp creep between waves after he gets his medalion he now starts making rotations around the map he eats a hard creep and then goes ganking till the creep expires then he keeps repeating this over and over again once he s fed enough he will have deso and hex and he will be able to take roshan and with that he will be able to walk up high ground with all of his advantage and just end the game at minutes This is where most people would stop their analysis because they think that s all there is to gameplay but this is only just scratching the surface Gameplay is split into parts the macro game and the micro game Macro game is all about your decision making it s about where do you go what do you do there what items do you go for how do you plan to use those items to win the game etc Micro game is all about pressing buttons it s your mechanical skill it s about which target do you chose in a teamfight what spells do you use on them where do you position during that fight etc Luckly we can analyse micro and macro game separately which is quite the bonus So you could say macro wise when he gets his deso is he gonna gank the enemy midlaner or safelaner OR is he just gonna use that to push towers Is he gonna use that to take roshan or you can say micro wise when he goes to gank is he gonna use his medalion first or his starfe Is he just gonna go on the target or position in a specific way Where is he gonna stand to kill that guy is he gonna wait for a spell to be thrown out or is he just gonna go for it Now there is a rd part which is very difficult to understand but it is the game sense part While the macro and macro game answer what how when questions game sense answers the why where question Every high mmr player tends to try to think trough the enemy s perspective and the decisions they make depend on that in higher games But this is very hard to analyse and it would be something you do after everything else is analysed What most people do is they have patterns for answering these questions but for you this will all fall into the game specific category For example when it comes to teamfights i personally almost always try to kill the guy with the most Crowd Control first then i go onto their midlaner then supports then carry then the rest But for you you d see me going for shaker first then their invoker then their disruptor then juggernaut for whatever reason you d say in that game Now let us analyse the macro game for the early game for that clinkz player What we are looking for is changes in gameplay given by new situations For example At level he has his nd ability he will use that to harass the enemy midlaner and secure last hits Against some matchups heroes he only last hits while against others he will walk up to their HG and harass them trade with them Why he does this is all about game sense and this is something that i simply can not show using a giant wall of text i d have to stream some analysis or something But a simple example would be knowing where the enemy roamer is which would allow him to decide His playstyle stays the same all up till he gets aquila + soul ring + lvl then he starts eating creeps in the hard camp and going back to lane to farm But then when he gets Medalion he starts roaming around the map When it comes to where he goes it s about game sense knowing which targets are easy to kill and which arent which targets need to be shut down and in which ways Now that the midgame is starting what is his pattern for the midgame macro game for midgame is very simple it s actually quite repetitive He soul rings a big creep in the hard camp goes towards a kill that he can find then if he has more time on his ultimate he will take another kill after his ult is down he goes and eats another creep in the jungle and repeats over and over again When he finishes deso he also starts taking towers if he kills someone near one but if he s not next to a tower he will keep killing around the map All up till he gets his hex he takes a couple of surprise pickoffs with it but with hex now he can start grouping with his team and taking roshan and towers and quickly ending the game There were not that many games for lategame as you know he stomps everything but usually what happens is he just gets more CC and tanky and keeps you in your base with the standard pincer method Now let us say you finsihed analysing the whole macro game now it s time to open another few replays and start predicting it happening again will he harass the enemy laner in the lane Will he eat the hard camp creeps when he gets soul ring will he go gank again when he gets his medalion will he rosh with his deso Now you can do the same analysis for the micro game when he goes for a kill where does he stand does he ping his teammates to go in does he wait What about the laning stage does he walk up to your HG to harass you or is he gonna sit on his HG against what matchups does he do one and against what does he do the other And then once you do that you can combine those macro and micro game to make a whole prediction But these are High accuracy low precision predictions This is what macro and micro game would show you Now it s time for the rd part game sense this is the hardest part as the only way you can learn this is simply by non stop making predictions unlike micro and macro game it simply almost DOES not repeat every game has different heroes different players and a different situation The way you d learn this is you d pause make a list of possible decisions weight them unpause and see if you were correct if you were you keep going if you were not then you go back and re analyse And you d do this for every single decision they d need to make seperately for macro and micro game So what are we talking about Well given macro game we know that after he eats a hard camp big creep he will go and gank someone so what we do now is we pause the game as soon as he eats that creep You are now sitting at a cross road and it s your job to find which path is the correct one there s enemy heroes we know he s gonna go try to kill one and in a specific place So you make theories on why is he gonna go for a specific target so let us say there s a juggernaut lone druid invoker on the enemy team for the juggernaut invoker we can say he wants to kill them to prevent them from becoming fat so that he has gold and they do not Or maybe it is not about going for the specific target maybe he goes for them because he wants to control that area they were farming a specific area he wants to limit their farm in that area Or maybe he will go for the lone druid kill because it s a hero that can take towers very early and he wants prevent that from happening then later he could kill invoker jugger Or maybe he wants to go for the lone druid because he s close to his radiance and killing him would give a lot of gold So you would make this list of reasons weight them and chose the one you think is most likely the answer unpause and look trough the whole map not just his perspective If you make the wrong prediction go re watch it from the enemy s perspective or his perspective again give yourself a new theory on why you were wrong what would have happened if he done the thing you would have done would he have failed would he have succeed even if he succeeded would it bring control to the map This is the hardest part it will usually take you like replays of analyzing the same situation over and over again and this is where you will see yourself failing the most you will make hundreds of wrong predictions till you finally nail that reason why he keeps going for invoker instead of lone druid And that s when and only then you will be playing like him and you will actually start grinding mmr for real And then once this is all done after k mmr grinded you will hit a new plateau where you will have to find a new hero or new role or new player to learn from the same way again p s it s a real big plus if you actually know that player if he s a stranger you can just try to add him to ask him because there s no better way of finding out what he s thinking other than from himself other tricks are to look trough the enemy s perspective or teammate s perspective sometimes the answer to your question simply is not trough his eyes but trough his enemies Sometimes the answer is about later in the game maybe minutes in the future i remember taking me replays to figure out why an arc warden spammer was winning every lane why i was losing them even though i was doing the exact same things it was because he kicked his supports out of lane after kills extra i do not like watching my own replays because you will not know your own mistakes The incompetent cannot know they are incompetent The skills you need to produce a right answer are exactly the skills you need to recognize what a right answer is David Dunning Because of this it is REALLY inefficient to analyse your own replays but if you really want to watch your replays look at every play that you did and ask yourself if you can do something different on the map dnot matter if you just killed someone or if you got killed no matter if you misclicked or enemy did To get better watching your own replays it s all about gamesense it s about creating that cross road and asking yourself is what i am doing right now the proper play Even if it works or not what could i have done differently analyzing gamesense is not necessary for a grind in low mmr you can get to like k just doing simple micro and macro game analysis but after k the whole game is only about gamesense decision making teamplay and map awareness It s inevitable to do so I guarantee you a large majority of k players have the same mechanical skill as k players tl dr bruh go watch some replays edit for those wondering how do they find good boosters

2667,2667,Anyone buy one of these things or seen one in person yet? Is the rear triangle the same as the 2018 epic? If it is then that bigger tire and rim mist have absolutely minimal clearance. Was looking at the regular expert epic at lbs and it had i22 rims with 2.1 tires and there was not much clearance there already. I can't imagine a real beefy tire or high volume XC tire fitting. I ride i29 with 2.35 XC tires and they measure 2.4 across so if they don't fit then no point in considering this bike sadly.

3313,3313,"Skincare Review! I was sent the Klairs Youthful Glow Sugar Mask free thanks to 08Liter to test and review and I‚Äôve had a lot of fun with this one üòä . üíï First Impressions: The scent is yummy and gives me all the summer vibes. It‚Äôs made with grapefruit extract and raspberry adding a boost of antioxidants, softens the skin using kaolin, jojoba oil and nourishing Shea butter moisturize and it even has calamine to soothe. . üíï This mask has multiple purposes. You can use to gently exfoliate or once applied you can leave it on for 10 minutes as a nourishing mask. I also learned by watching a video from the brand this is safe to use on your lips as a scrub. . üíï My Experience: The first time I used this scrub I exfoliated with it, the texture is very balanced- you can feel all the dead skin being scrubbed off and the oil is just enough to feel nourishing without being heavy. As a mask it‚Äôs the same. It does get a little messy but rinses off clean and fast. Unfortunately for me, this made my skin feel dry and tight afterward- even after using as a mask. I was very surprised especially since it feels so nourishing while on. Thankfully I can just continue my normal skincare routine and my moisturizer balances me back out. . üßê Overall: I think this will be a good product to use during the hot and humid months here in the south since My skin doesn‚Äôt require as much nourishment. I have been using it as a lip scrub quite regularly and really like it for that!"

7150,7150,"A Tesla Model 3 police car made an appearance at the Accelerate Policing conference, an event hosted by law enforcement tech company Axon. The symposium was held in Phoenix, AZ, and it featured presentations and discussions on recent innovations for the law enforcement industry. Images taken of the Model 3 police vehicle suggest that the electric car was specifically modified by Axon itself, as well as Tomar, a manufacturer of police car equipment. Wrapped in matte silver and white and emblazoned with the words ‚ÄúPolice‚Äù in classic Tesla font, the Model 3 looked every bit like a police cruiser. Modifications such as a lightbar inside the cabin and police lights on the side mirrors also give the electric cruiser a distinctly futuristic look. , the Model 3 police car was fitted with what appeared to be 20‚Ä≥ wheels, which are great for performance but not really practical for police duty. The vehicle also appears to be a non-performance Model 3, due to the absence of red brake calipers. While Axon‚Äôs Model 3 police car appears to have been built simply as a concept, the idea of using the electric sedan for law enforcement actually makes a lot of sense. Teslas have been used by police for years, though the high costs of the Model S and Model X have largely prevented their widespread use. This issue is not present with the Model 3, which costs significantly less than the premium sedan and SUV. Axon‚Äôs Tesla Model 3 police car. (Photo: t0mmyr /Reddit)"

11727,11727,Photo Courtesy of Elizabeth Buxton What actually happened Prep Time minutes Cook Time minutes Total Time minutes I settled on this speedy pasta recipe for my second attempt And truth be told it was speedy The entire dish was essentially cooked in one pot with only a few additional ingredients Although it took me a bit over the designated time I still clocked in under the half hour mark making this a weeknight success Normally I would want some extra protein meat or even a side salad to go with my dinner But folks those things take time time does not quite fit within that minute meal constraint Advertisement Mini Sausage Meatball Minestra Rachael Ray Prep Time minutes Cook Time minutes Total Time minutes Photo Courtesy of Elizabeth Buxton What actually happened Prep Time minutes Cook Time minutes Total Time hour During my final test obviously a soup recipe things really started to go downhill The queen of Minute Meals collection page managed to pull some serious wool over my eyes I selected a recipe that was mixed in with other minute meals only to find out later that it actually listed a total time of an hour While the cook time was indeed minutes it also took more than a half hour to prep I discovered this rather large timing discrepancy after I had already gone grocery shopping Flash forward to an amount of chopping meatball rolling and browning that was enough to put me off ever making a minestra again But I pushed through and an hour later the end result was entirely delicious Regardless of if Rachael Ray led me astray or I led myself down the path of weeknight cooking destruction I still felt thoroughly frustrated by the time dinner was ready So here s my take on the minute meal Recipes that fall under the fast and easy category end up feeling more like a panic inducing time crunch or as my concerned roommates pointed out a sad episode of Chopped Cooking for me is therapeutic even after a long day at work and I do not want to feel like Ted Allen and a panel of judges are screaming at me to get my food on the plate Whether the designated amount of time is or even minutes it does not matter much if your main focus is fighting against a clock and your better judgement for consuming raw meat Sometimes good dinners take time And not everyone has a sous chef or serious chopping and meatball rolling skills Obviously I will not be committing to a four course dining experience during the week anytime soon but instead I will be working towards finding what meals work for me and my skills on my own damn time Who s with me Advertisement

8214,8214,". ‚ñ™Ô∏èHomemade Tortellini with Tomato Sauce ‚ñ´Ô∏èI love to make my own tortellini, I can put my favourite ingredients and how much I like the filling in one piece. Sometimes I find the restaurants making the pasta skin too thick and I prefer mine thin. Therefore I have made this tortellini in Spinach Ricotta and Hazelnut. Let me guide you through the steps! ‚¨áÔ∏è Pasta dough: All-purpose Flour 200g Egg 2pcs Water 10g Salt 4g Filling: Spinach 200g Ricotta 125g Hazelnut 80g Tomato sauce: Shallot 1pc Garlic 1pc Thyme 1pc Roma Tomato 3pc Pasta dough: Dissolve the salt in water, mix eggs and flour then add your salted water. Knead in a dough. Rest for 30mins. Cut the dough in 4, Then Roll out until around 1.5mm thin with a pasta machine. Cut the edges to make a perfect rectangle. Then again cut them into 5cm squares. Blanch your spinach in salted water quickly for 10seconds, strain and press out water, chop it fine. Roast the heazelnut at 160‚ÄôC for 10mins, cool it and chop fine. Mix the spinach, ricotta and hazelnut, season with salt and pepper. Here you can start making your tortellini! Remove skin of tomato by cutting a small cross on the bottom of the tomato, blanch it in boiling water for 10seconds and you will see the skin easily comes off. Place the tomatoes in ice, cut in small cubes when they are cooled. Fry chopped garlics and chopped shallots with olive oil, add your tomato cubes and thym, saut√© for 5minutes then add 1.5 cup of water. Leave it to simmer for 20minutes. Mix the sauce with a handhold mixer or a juice mixer. Here is your authentic tomato sauce. Cook your tortellini in salted water for 2minutes and finish the cooking by roasting them in your tomato sauce. Serve with some grated cheese! Bon App√©tit!"

5523,5523,Sorry to have missed this live my dude SPOILER Click to show The opener was kind of a clusterfuck lol Not in a bad way mind Just some three way spots missed and such And pretty slow going at first for a lucha match Then the Tomas approved spot really turned the tide Macho dragging Cicatrices only to get absolutely rocked was great Then a cool double team with Guerrero holding the dude for a dropkick by Hexagon Solida del Sol into the running senton and counter rana spot was fucking awessomeee And the biggggg dive whiff hahahahaha Big fuck up by not pinning off the big ol twisty doo senton and it cost Guerrero Match started slow but eventually got to be fun with a good ending Great subtle touch with the ref having the LUCHA Power logo too Dojo texture s looking real sharp too And I liked that you generally kept your camera cuts to a minimum and let shots be pretty static for a good long while It worked well Jack Gold looks like such an indie dirtbag lol and I mean that in the best way He s just such a prototypical indie guy with his bad hair and his beard I saw you wanted to push him so I am glad he won It was a solid match with Gold showcasing his technical skills Winning with a flash pin seems very fitting for his character too I think he can make a great upper midcard midcard cocky shitbag heel so excited to see what a push looks like for him Nightmare Clown and Dominguez was a solid match but a bit of a momentum killer for the show Dunno how to have solved that problem to be fair Just a bit slow paced compared to everything else Was pulling for Nightmare Clown for the sake of an upset but alas Andddd also Dominguez is a dickbag for that post match attack lol Haaahahaha Yes yes I was running a stream at Sometimes it pays to be Canadian and with a smaller ISP in a relatively small building with not many tenants Really liked the main event Great back and forth match and good to see the pace pick up from the last match Lots of good lucha technical shit Top rope poison rana spot in particular was nasty LOVED the finishing sequence with the Slingblade follow ups being missed two times but the follow up to the Superstar Elbow after the taunt too finally connecting I was really pulling for a Lobo win but PNJ just got the title and it makes him look strong Lobo still looked like a million bucks too Overall some fun shit Good to see a shorter show too Made it digestible Opener started slow but picked up Gold looked good and the main event was really great Only dud was the Nightmare Clown and Dominguez match and it wasn t even really a dud so much as just kind of a standard affair that stuck out a bit more for being a bit slow All in all though good shit

1822,1822,"The hot start procedure that Paul reccommends seems to work on Lyc powered Mooneys, and Pipers from what I¬íve read on hot start forums. A minor change to that procedure that also helps is to turn on the boost pump for 2 or 3 seconds with the mixture in idle cutoff and throttle full open, just before engaging the starter. This pressurizes the system up to the servo, but no fuel flows up to the spider with the mixture in ico on a Lycoming. Not so with a Conti engine with a Bendix fuel injection, but with our Lycomings there¬ís enough fuel vapor in the lines on a hot engine to get it started. Then the pressurized fuel from the servo and the engine driven pump take over. Remember you have to move the throttle back to a high idle position as it starts, and then slowly move the mixture out of ico. This should work until the engine cools enough to where there isn¬ít enough fuel rich vapor in the spider and upper lines to support the start - in which case you¬íll need to prime before start (cold start)."

12098,12098,I reviewed a pile of mask designs yesterday looking for the most intelligent design I am going to go with this one which is a neater tighter fit of the same style OP posted It has a nose wire to mold the mask to your face at the top which is an absolute must if you do not want steamy glasses Pattern Ties They also did something more intelligent about the ties People complain that over ear masks hurt their ears over time Better is to use a continuous loop of elastic so the mask ties go around the back of the head The knot in the elastic is hidden in the channel so you can easily pull it out re knot and trim it and hide it again if you need to go shorter You can also pull the top band to the bottom and the bottom band to the top so they criss cross to shorten things up Bottom line if in doubt how long to make ties go a little long because that can be fixed by the end user You can also use a long shoelace Converse hi top length Then you would thread the lace up the left channel across and down the right channel and leave the ends dangling loose at the bottom You have made a loop for the top back of your head and can draw the loose laces back and tie them at the bottom back of your head I have decided I am going to use stretchy hair bands that I got at Dollarama X pk at each is enough for masks You have to buy these in pairs so you have enough to match up colours the bundles have black one white one gray one athletic gray For wire I picked up some garden wire at for m which is thick but soft and easy to bend At about cm per mask that is enough for masks Fabric You want cotton up to cotton polyester finely woven fabric High thread count bed sheets are great Quilting cotton also very good You need to size it wash it hot dry it hot so maximum shrinkage happens I have some quilting fabric and picked up a twin bed sheet at Walmart so I have a plain coloured lining It s important to be able to tell the front from the back if you happen to take it off for a moment after wearing it which is why I picked up the plain sheet Make sure you read the content on any bed sheets because a lot of them are microfiber polyester these days Filter You need a non woven fabric imagine the stuff Bounce dryer sheets are made of Non fusible interfacing is perfect You do not want the fusible kind because the glue will affect the function of the filter Most people seem to be going for Pellon non fusible interfacing or equivalent which I got from the amazing Len s Mill Stores They have online or telephone ordering pickup service or ship to home Pellon is m Additional filter These mask patterns were originally designed so you could stuff a surgical mask inside as a filter but hide the ugly look of wearing a surgical mask on its own Note that this pattern has a few options and one of the last variations they show is with a pocket I recommend you sew that version so you have the option for extra filtering That s the plan

4691,4691,Riasu lay on her cot trying to sleep though she tossed and turned The voices were loud and unfamiliar Her emotions were heightened and it made her control sloppy She placed her pillow over her head groaning trying to dampen the sound It did nothing for her Obviously She clenched her jaw and threw the pillow off Oh shells The dark skinned woman sat up and moved to swing her legs down but stopped herself She needed sleep She thought about waking Jarath he could always talk her into sleep He and Breeanth her mother s green had been major influencers in helping Riasu learn to control her ability Focusing on one voice out of the many was key Still she didn t have the heart to wake the beast it wasn t his fault she couldn t sleep Instead she closed her eyes sifting through the voices that bombarded hers until she found a most chatty female voice It sounded much like Breeanth s though obviously younger and much more rambunctious The female voice a green she guessed was gossiping about the latest news something about the weyrwoman though Riasu gathered she was coming in late to the conversation It didn t help she could only hear one side of it She didn t bother to focus on the words instead just allowed the constant chatter to lull her into slumber Though the slumber wasn t deep nor restful She wore her riding leathers mostly because she liked the way he looked at her when she wore them but also because she hoped to convince D min and Solith to take an outing with her Maybe somewhere warmer like Southern He would be in a good mood she supposed as he would be coming in from threadfighting training for the newest weyrlings Riasu waited for him in his weyr she had thought to bring a book because she knew how much he liked to correct and lecture when it came to threadfighting I don t like it I don t like this at all Solith s voice reached her mind unheedingly and Riasu was surprised by the anger behind it What s wrong dear beast She asked concerned but the brown didn t respond The quiet was eerie She is waiting in our weyr Her eyebrows folded in and she closed the book just as D min walked in Since when did D min need a warning of her presence He did not look happy What s wrong my love Riasu set aside the book standing and going to the weyrleader concern apparent in her voice She quickly approached the taller man and threaded her arms around his waist kissing his chin He didn t respond At least not the way she expected He took her shoulders and pushed her away turning to face away from her She tried to move so she could see his face but he kept his back firmly to her Something was not right Not right at all D min She prodded and he set his shoulders What are we doing His voice was angry and Riasu blinked What do you mean She asked her voice guarded She stepped away from him but did not dare turn her back on him She would not be so vulnerable I mean what am I kidding You re a child What am I doing You don t even have a dragon for Faranth s sake Riasu raised her eyebrows her eyes widening He was lashing out but why I am no child I think I ve already proved that to you Multiple times And I will have a dragon Is this about me not standing for the last hatching There wasn t a gold egg I thought we decided to wait You decided you mean He turned and pointed at her accusingly This was an old argument but they had settled it almost a turn ago I am my own woman I thought you appreciated that She lifted her chin brows furrowing and we both ended up agreeing Where is this coming from Her voice raised on its own accord and she blinked back tears She would not show him weakness I m just sick and tired of you not listening to me You think you know what s best but you don t I m sick and tired of you You weren t so tired of me last night He didn t answer just clenched his jaw looking at her Her head tilted confusion filling the void She was afraid of where this was heading This isn t about me is it It was his turn to blink and his eyes widened His whole body stiffened What do you mean of course it is No I don t think so She shook her head she couldn t believe it How could she be so deadglow This isn t about me nor the fact I don t have a dragon yet This is about you Now it was her turn to point accusingly at him and she took a few steps forward fuming What s her name D min Which flitter brained woman did you knock up Afraid she ll come out and tell me She spat at him Thought you d just end it and save the embarrassment of a public encounter when I found out Riasu clenched her hands I I He was searching for words as if he was looking for any other excuse I didn t cheat Ri I wouldn t He almost sounded convincing Oh really She chuckled rolling her eyes How flitter brained do you think I am D min rubbed his face I Don t Don t even If there is one thing you ve proved it s that I m a fool for loving you A tear slipped out uncontrolled and she angrily wiped it away She turned to stalk out but she stopped and looked over her shoulder Was it Is it Arecie She had wondered He didn t answer just looked at the ceiling of his weyr She looked away more tears were coming and they burned You are going to regret this D min I ll show you The tall woman marched out slamming the door behind her His voice crept in quiet mournful He is sorry I will miss you She lost it sobbing as she ran to anywhere but there She gasped sitting up suddenly her eyes full of liquid and her throat thick Shard it She whispered Solith s apology resounding in her ears a ghost of a whisper against the bombardment of unfamiliar voices re entering her head For a time she stared at her knees eyes closed trying to focus Then she shook her hair out stood and moved to the door of the candidate s section She needed to walk it off She needed to walk them off The woman decided the best way would be to drown them out She took a breath and let down her mental barricade that saved her from the brunt of the voices and allowed the voices to do just that Drown them out She started running glad she had thought to sleep in exercise worthy clothes and embraced the voices letting them numb her

591,591,It has been a few years since I last wrote an essay for your superb website a little fresh virtual ink so to speak As always government turns things upside down I spent nine years working in Cardiac Surgery and I learned a thing or two about healthcare during this time Here are my opinions along with a little science Surgeons nurses and other operating room personnel in a surgical suite wear masks They wear these masks in an attempt to mitigate the affects of the normal human body During surgery the body cavity is open exposing the sterile interior to the outside un sterile world This world is a biological soup of dirt debris chemicals viruses and bacteria Any of these landing in the sterile interior can potentially be very bad leading to infections sepsis and death Human beings respire and with the warm breath can come any number of things of the aforementioned biological soup Surgical suites cannot prevent airflow and the wind can bring lots of un sterile things into the sterile field I have never seen a gas tight surgical suite with an airlock so when the patient staff enter exit the air we breathe can drag a lot of other things along for the ride Surgical masks protect the patient from the surgical staff and the un sterile surgical environment they were not designed to protect the wearer of the mask from the patient Fast forward to the current mess the government has thrown us into and daily there is a cry for more masks to protect everyone from the coronoavirus Social distancing is a policy designed to implement this along with masks I go to the grocery store every day to get a feel for what is available and what is not my own economic research I also buy things that were not available yesterday but might ne today In the past week about half the customers in the store have started to wear masks so the other half do not Same thing with the staff Many of these masks you can tell have been worn many times not the use once and discard one finds in a surgical environment This means they have been put on taken off and stored who knows where so much for their cleanliness A little physics here is what the ideal gas law and kinetic theory can tell us Gases at room temperature have an average velocity around meters second Fast Now gas molecules bump into one another thus the mean free path how far they move between collisions is relatively small which means gas molecules do not go very far before they bump into one another In vacuum a feather and a iron shot put fall at the same speed but in the atmosphere at ground level the feather will stay in the air longer same thing with a virus particle A coronoavirus is much bigger than an atom but is still tiny compared to the macroscopic world of multi cellular animal life like us This means that they will stay in the air for sometime before being pulled down by gravity Thus cornoavirus particles can and will seep around the edges of the surgical mask These masks do not make a gas tight seal They were designed to contain spittle and particles from talking breathing coughing or sneezing of the surgical staff from getting into the sterile body cavity Same thing goes for whatever is found in mustaches and beards Washing one s hands every time you are outside of your home promptly when you return and not touching your eyes face and mouth are very important as these are the portal through which viruses can enter the body In my opinion this is more important than wearing a mask unless you are positive for coronoavirus and you do not want to infect others I would also recommend buying a sterile saline nose spray to keep the lining of your nose moist which is known to prevent viruses and bacteria from getting across the skin barrier into the blood stream Hand sanitizer is in short supply My local Walgreen s ran out of rubbing alcohol a day or two into the declared social distancing Rubbing alcohol also known as isopropyl alcohol is what sanitizes as it in effect will posion any virus or bacteria it comes in contact with A little chemistry here liquid dish detergent is a superb cleaning agent Put a spot the size of a quarter in your hand rub it all over your hands before wetting with water Detergents are a class of chemicals called surfactants they lower the surface tension of water thus serve to dissolve contamination from the surface of the skin Add a small amount of water and vigorously rub your hands together before rinsing with flowing water You will be able to feel when your hands are rinsed clean I always recommend buying generic household chemicals as they are less expensive since they do not have advertising budgets and TV time priced into their contents Sam s Club sells a gallon of pink dish washing liquid for a very cost effective solution While they limit purchases to one per day they have not run out so far If all else fails and you are desperate for a sanitizing solution go to your local hardware store Lowe s or Home Depot and buy a gallon of denatured alcohol it costs about Quarts are about Use a tablespoon in place of hand sanitizer and it will get the job done There are a lot of tablespoons in a gallon You CANNOT drink it it is not that kind of ethyl alcohol The government requires a poison be added this is the denaturing part to prevent drinking It will work just fine as a hand sanitizer Do not buy acetone mineral spirits or turpentine if you cannot get denatured alcohol as they really are poisonous All of these sanitizing agents also strip the natural oils and chemicals the body coats the surface of the skin with Every pore of your skin exudes these chemicals They are an essential part of your immune system Use a skin moisturizing lotion I prefer Lubriderm and Cerave but almost any one will do Read the ingredients listed Ingredients are required by law to be listed in the order of decreasing amount The first chemical listed will be present in the greatest amount the second next largest on down A useful federal law Use this to restore moisture This moisture is actually a layer of an oily chemicals and it will help protect the skin while it your metabolism restores its chemical balance Americans have been conditioned by advertising to bathe daily and keep clean This is a product of the marketing department to increase sales but actually works to the detriment of society at large Animals spent roughly million years evolving and nature always knows best If nature went to the trouble of developing skin as part of your immune system then it is best to try and preserve it We do not need to use scrub surfactant chemicals every day to get that clean feeling we are stripping these essential chemicals from our skin I recommend washing the crotch arm pits with surfactant cleaners and let flowing water do the rest Shampoo strips natural chemicals from your hair Back when I had hair I did a test of rinsing my hair with water when showering but not using shampoo and I found that after about three weeks the luster returned once I stopped stripping away the essential chemicals that nature provided no more shampoo not that I need it anymore Asthma is literally unknown in the third world a world with as lot less bathing and daily surfactant application Many believe this is the cause of asthma I do not know but I do know someone severely asthamatic and their solution was to cut down on showering a natural solution A little chemistry here can go a long way with helping the body and its natural biochemistry provide the immunity which is what always saves us The great Roman orator Cicero wrote roughly fifty years before Christ was born that the physician treats but nature heals He was beheaded by the Roman government at age a classic government program if ever there was one It is not knowledge but the act of learning not possession but the act of getting there which grants the greatest enjoyment

her anyway If she can use it it needs a die size I think Set up the mana drainer inside the magicoal pile room It does not need to encase the pile and I do not want to take any risks setting up a giant drainer I just want a decently large net that ll steadily siphon off mana to storage even if it s massively inefficient As for the nature of the storage well I can not recall you describing thaumic mana batteries before but seeing as how practically everything in this place uses the same mana wires I figure Ekrov has seen some kind of mana storage by now Set something up Next the teleport rods Go find an out of the way room that is locked behind an aristocrat door which does not contain anything important Set up the teleport rod inside that room it ll be an iron rod as tall as a person set into a base that keeps it rigidly supported and fixed in position Use magic to summon it up if necessary I do not care Using Iron Banish and Human Enchant it to be able to teleport a person to or from a specific other rod of iron which is only a foot long when a passphrase is spoken and magic is pumped into it or the handheld rod Teleports only teleport the person spending the mana along with whatever they are holding aside from the rod itself so you can teleport back to where it is We will probably set up a more permanent arrangement later so for now a simple person transporter is good enough And do not tell Zavi about this Saeko can know of course and will get told the passphrase but Zavi and the crew do not need to know anything Spend mana buffing Senses to

time we have left in Gravid and which may be extended if it s not a terrible idea Words are Human and Animate Once the clone is summoned talk to her and interview her I want to know what her mind and powers are like Is her mind based off of Zavi s impression of Saeko as she was the artist Or Ekrov s since he s the animator See if Saeko will help and have her ask about things only Saeko would know does the clone of her have her memories despite her not being involved in its creation at all Does the clone Saeko have any magic or mana Does she have the physical and mental acuity of Saeko or only the capability Ekrov s magic could grant her Is there anything else interesting that Ekrov notices And melt magicoal Hey even if it s only chunk it s something Spoiler O o click to show hide Name

wonderment he seems continually fascinated but almost amused as well as if there s a hidden joke in everything he sees He wears a clearly high quality outfit but to his credit it looks unusually practical for a noble subdued brown in color and light aside from thin pieces of light leather in strategic locations clearly intended more as protection than a fashion statement He carries a small

6961,6961,"FlyByKnight said: SedrynTyros said: FlyByKnight said: I'm not hedging on the success of any specific currency but I really hate seeing people say absolutely stupidly wrong things for the sake of their personal opinion. It seems to be the same brain surgeons too. To say crypto currency has ""no backing"" while search engines exist is the talk of an absolute imbecile. Calling all of them ""ponzi-scheme"" is imbecilic. You're upset because you can't buy a graphic card so you can play video games. I get it, 't be daft. It's new, the market is not regulated, and there's a lot of gambling going on. Naturally that causes sharks to circle the waters. It's still not intelligent to brush with broad strokes. The same companies you all bank with, buy processors from, and purchase fuel from are heavily vested in block chain AND crypto. It's not going anywhere any time soon. If you think the jackass who literally caused the Dow to drop 700+ points because ""trade wars are easy"" is gonna do ANY THING you're a fool. That's 2 more years of holding your breath right there. As long as there is some real tech and solid white paper behind some of these companies don't expect it all to disappear. I suggest you all strap the hell in, do some research and speak from a position of knowledge at the least. I think there will eventually be ""official"" crypto-currencies that are backed by governments and the banking system, but anyone who thinks unregulated crypto like bitcoin and ethereum will stand the test of time is living in fantasy land. And all that's required to recognize that is a basic understanding of how currency works; no google-fu needed. So what do you call the crypto-currencies that are already backed by banks and governments? Repeating incorrect things over and over doesn't make them correct, it only makes you leader of the free world. Sorry, but there are no legitimate banks that support crypto currency. You are mistaken."

To me it would be a no brainer to get the watch that fascinates me, not everybody and their mom's default. An Omega co-ax is far more special and personal than any Rolex, but I would go much further than that. Think Dornbl√ºth, Hentschel, etc. Any piece that actually involves communication with the watchmaker, not just putting money on the table. Anyone can do that. The cool thing about the whole watch hobby is that we appreciate things others don't even know about. But as I said, that's just me.[/QUOTE] You're right - anyone can put money on the table to buy a watch and pass it on to their child. Just like anyone can pull out a slightly bigger credit card and do the same with Dornbl√ºth, Hentschel, etc. The watch itself is a means to an end, and the name on the watch's face is relatively inconsequential. It's the stories created while wearing the watch that make it special; it's the fact that memories across one's childhood include the consistency of ""dad's watch."" And that's why, for many, a Rolex isn't ""stupid."" It's a nice watch that will shrug off many of the bumps and bruises it will receive on a father's wrist, and can be serviced and maintained quickly and efficiently."

155,155,Will this really be of use to your story or players Not in the slightest This is like the kind of thing I see in tutorials on video games that claim to be open ended and are actually heavily rail roaded Make it a past incarnation thing or better yet work up to it At first give them some bad dreams night scratches and the like No explanation poker face Keep this going a few sessions but do not introduce it Vague barely remembered dreams of an unstoppable darkness Then through sequence of events of your device they meet someone who hires them An elusive person hiding as she stalks about town She is clearly younger than thirty and has the kind of appearance that she has never adventured If pressed she speaks this all for the sake of her child in hushed tones Investigation in town reveals she is the widow of the son of a Paladin who died out on the search for glory or something and her husband was in his party that met their tragic fate His party never returned and no one found the body passed and she started wearing mourning clothes a few weeks after they left That was five years ago Some may think he just ran off There is even a rumour he found great fortune and assumed a title and new identity People in town think she cracked They are hired by her with loot from her late husband to find his group of level adventurers who went missing If they do not buy the widow thing they find her meeting with a few others in town maybe some who gave them information misdirection If pressed or convinced they are reveal they are an enclave of cultists who were redeemed by and now swear to protect The Door She had been wearing mourning clothes to hide her pregnancy They are to find the remains of the party they sent and being them back or at least bring back any jewels or gems they find on their persons if you want to entice them Gems Send the party on the road to adventure and lo and behold they find the battle site If you are railroading they happen upon it by chance They bring back the stuff or if they run off with it they are brought back Party was chosen by the Door and such talk The Door is a child of exotic features of some years old with amazing levels of psionic ability The mother reveals her husband has returned to her or so she thought The adventurers are coerced intimidated or rewarded until they agree to don the gear or maybe just a necklace the cult gave them Let them choose One slightly ephemeral or weird rite later they stand float astrally close to these level TEN persons surrounded by dead minions lightly wounded already buffed with spells and such BBEG sneers crushes his soul eater gem and the bodies fall to the ground their minds shattered The party find themselves sucked into the lifeless bodies and they play the combat with the character sheets you hand out of the level party They are played with at first the BBEG toying with them and confused why his one shot destroyed on use item killed the party but they did not stay dead Maybe he gets really close to one in a struggle looks through the body s eyes and says This is not your bodyz who are you A portal starts slowly opening and looks terrified He starts fighting harder with fear less toying with these people in a boastful way and more That s not how this is supposed to work He outclasses them easily He gets the upper hand and the party falls Right before the party member falls they snap out of the body and back to the astral proximity As they fall a portal opens and he kneels on one leg or bows and a voice says What is taking so long He replies nothing my Lord Lady Mistress Master just but a slight distraction as I waited for your arrival The voice in the portal says Change of Plans return so we can discuss how to deal with any future distractions As he walks through the portal the effects of his polymorph spell begin to wear off DM Note the BBEG they fought is the captain of someone else more powerful BBEG He is planning a coup and needs The Door for his own plans The Door is his own child The young woman was drugged and or seduced by the BBEG they just fought who returned one night impregnated her and revealed his plan The child will be his ultimate success and he will be back for him her on his th birthday The BBEG Master or Mistress does not even know the child exists The BBEG they fought cannot visit the child or he risks revealing his own plans for betrayal The town does not and must not know of the child They will kill him and this will unleash the power the BBEG hopes to harness basically a psionic nuke The cult he left to conceal the child has themselves turned on him and swear to protect the child And they need the party to help do it Just a morning coffee thought Hope it helps As for your world It only takes a year to go from rd to th level
11431,11431,"I don't respect outright hypocrites. I value integrity and honesty. It's important, for me, that people have ethics and are honest about their shortcomings. Your bar for trust and respect might be buried six feet under the ground, but mine isn't, and I don't intend to lower it. Donald Trump is one person, not half of the country. I have every right to criticize spineless, bankrupt, conservative hypocrites who bend over like a air-powered tube man in front of a car wash to excuse every detestable thing Donald Trump has done while building the Burj Khalifa out of a speck of dust for anything liberals do. I have that right because I expect people to act in an ethical manner, and I hold everyone to the same standards, regardless of their political affiliation. I am not a hypocrite. If you support Donald Trump, you have no right to talk about what's good for Democrats. You wallow in mud, like a pig. You can't claim to care about cleanliness. Just because you have an opinion doesn't mean you get a seat at the table with the adults. You don't get to act like a child and expect to be treated like an adult. You are a hypocrite, and that makes your opinion worth zero."

11556,11556,Chapter One Solace in Seclusion There s something comforting to be found in true darkness Something which isn t present on your average starry night or unlit room It takes more than just turning off the lights to experience it This feeling of contentment can only be found in the actual complete absence of light Dagvald has found this pleasure in the underground shelter he dug for himself beneath his compound in the woods The ceiling is not just a barrier to entry it is a barrier to pervasive illumination A wooden trapdoor has kept Dag in the dark for twenty three hours and thirty seven minutes There is no food in this shelter Nor is there anything to drink For over a day the Prophesied One has fasted not for religious or dietary reasons but for ancient tradition For most today is a day of celebration and gluttony Across the world New Year s Eve marks a time for celebration great feasts and engorgement on alcohol This was true even in olden times but then there were some who did not partake in such worldly festivities In Scandinavia there were those fearless or foolish few who sought to gain a glimpse of the vision enjoyed by Odin himself The All Father enjoys sight beyond that of any other immortal and certainly any lowly mortal He can foresee the future observe the present and recall the past in perfect clarity Humans have been envious of this ability since they learned of their creator Medieval man had gone to great lengths to see the future for themselves They sought answers to questions everyone wanted to know Would they acquire great wealth Would they die an honorable death Would they find love In Dagvald s homeland perhaps the realm where nature and mankind were most closely linked before the desert cult destroyed paganism his ancestors believed they found a way to catch just a peek into their futures They called it Year Walking During certain days of the year when that link was strongest a ritual may be performed to peer into what lie ahead in the year to come The day when this practice was most effective was New Year s Eve First they locked themselves up in a dark room They were not allowed to see light for an entire day During that day they also could not partake in any feasts or libations At the stroke of midnight they exited the darkness and entered the woods outside their village That last second before midnight was the last chance to change their mind and abandon the taboo practice Once the clock struck there was no going back For a man desperate to be reunited with the spirits who bore him and to find out whether his efforts were going to waste or not a Year Walk is the perfect opportunity Sitting hunched over in the fetal position in this cramped hole in the ground he reflects on what he may see in the night ahead Legends speak of monstrous visions revealing riddles to those who seek them The monsters of Scandinavian folklore are oft mentioned in tales of Year Walking confronting those who dared to try and gain the wisdom of the gods with puzzles that challenge the mind He has tried not to spend this solitary time reflecting on the frustrations of his past Trapping oneself in a confined space with nothing to do but think is an easy way to be driven to madness The insanity of Dag s life is certainly not lost on him From social outcast loner to arsonist to prison inmate to self imposed exile to wrestler to international revolutionary He had achieved great success in both of his latest endeavors only to have it ripped from him due to cosmically unfair means Sometimes he wonders if he will ever find his true calling Is he really cut out to bear the burden placed upon him by the gods After the fallout from the defeat in the Stockholm Riots Dag has returned to his compound in the United States Now that he s had a taste of life back in the Motherland he longs to return there and live in his ancestral rite The authoritarians in power have made this impossible yet again however at least for the time being Instead he has chosen to bring the homeland back with him through this ancient tradition He is desperate to find guidance for the year ahead He feels lost swirling in uncertainty unable to plot out the course to achieving his destiny If the gods truly do favor him then they will give him a sign tonight In just moments he will lift the hatch and begin his Year Walk a practice which died a century and a half ago Heill inn s l inn he repeats in his mind as the final seconds count down Heill inn s l inn Finally the hands on his watch align at the zero hour May the gods have mercy upon my soul He raises the trap door roof and climbs out of the shelter At first even the moonlight is blinding After so long in absolute darkness what little light there is threatens to overwhelm him The effects of the Year Walk seem to be taking effect almost immediately The light is so powerfully vibrant Dag swears he can hear it Trust in the light let it be your guide For too long you have basked in the darkness seeking companionship among those who dwell in shadow thrived where most won t go This has only blinded you and to go forward you must embrace your vision The words don t come in the form of a voice They are not heard They are simply present in Dag s mind Then his eyes abruptly adjust to the night environment Nothing immediately out of the ordinary he thinks to himself Then again I m not quite sure what I m expecting He simply decides to begin walking the approximately three mile trail to his destination Every Year Walk came to its conclusion at the village church and Dag has mapped out a direct route to a suitable location It is eerie to be alone in the dark woods and the feeling of uneasiness is amplified by the lack of food and hydration Some say the supernatural effects of Year Walks were simply the vision quest results of lack of sleep and nourishment Dagvald seeks to find the truth in the power of his gods tonight Chapter Two The Horse and the Boy Several yards go by as he treks from his compound towards the trail which will take him directly to the church It follows an old railroad route abandoned for several decades Ahead of him he can see the moonlight reflecting off the very large pond which sits beside the path up the hill to the main trail above He canters slowly up to it and begins to notice a slight migraine growing in intensity as he draws nearer to the body of stagnant water Let the games begin our villain dismissively murmurs in his head As he starts to pass the pool he notices a seemingly shapeless form move beneath the muddy water Perhaps he should ignore it the walker wonders Whatever it is may not be good for his health But then what else am I out here for He stops Like an alligator the entity seamlessly swims through the pond toward him As it approaches the shore it stops and begins to raise it s bizarre figure into the open for all to behold a pale horse An equestrian entity for sure it s head is that of a horse while it s torso is that of a man It s skin is the same tone as the sickly white hair of its mane The beast s horse legs are still half submerged in water Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the entity as a whole is how well dressed it is sporting a rather fetching Victorian tuxedo which doesn t seem to even be moist The creature extends his arm inviting Dag to take his hand and locking eyes B ckah sten Dag utters Aren t I a little old for you to be luring me onto your back It s my understanding you like the easy meat child murderer The Brook Horse indignantly replies You ve got it all wrong Mr Riddik I thought you knew your people s history tsk tsk The mythical entity s voice is crystal clear just like the water of the lake suddenly is I do not exist simply to capture the souls of innocent children I carry the lost young ones to Valhalla I am only visible to those whose fate is already decided in fact Since you can see me I m afraid it s already too late Are you threatening me foul creature Dag spits Ever easy to antagonize he hastily draws his sword He is glad he brought it though he hadn t expected to need it so soon on his journey The Brooke Horse just whinnies probably an equine substitute for a human chuckle Oh now Shattered One if only my intentions were that simple How much easier it would be for you to face me if it were in combat No I m afraid it s much more complex than that though the reward you stand to gain from me is far greater than the satisfaction of defeating an enemy in battle My purpose with you is to guide the lost fraction of your soul to the peak of Yggdrasil where he shall rejoice with the gods and your ancestors in the Great Hall Dagvald unable to decipher exactly what the abomination is trying to say still can only perceive it as some sort of veiled threat Still you speak of stealing my soul away from the mortal realm and carrying it to that of the dead I cannot interpret this any other way If you want a fight then just speak your mind foul beast and a glorious battle we shall have He brandishes his ancient Viking blade authentically forged in blacksmith shops of those who once raided and conquered the furthest reaches of Europe and beyond The moonlight reflects off of it beautifully even bouncing into the eye of the Brook Horse In return the half man half horse neighs again clearly wishing he could laugh like he could if his head were also human So much hostility Dagvald as though the extent of your research into the likes of me was nothing more than reading children s bedtime stories You really ought to know this by now but since you insist on playing uneducated I ll break it down for you Your soul is fractured dear brother Before you as in the real you may reach Valhalla you must shed each of the many fragments as a snake sheds its skin I am here to relieve you of what remains of your childhood innocence Disbelief swallows Dag into a chasm of confusion You claim to know so much about me while implying I have some sort of so called innocence which must be washed away You know nothing about me creature You are just a myth an illusion Nothing about me is innocent I never even had a real childhood of that I assure you Now begone so I may continue on my journey and foresee my ultimate destiny Dagvald turns away from the stagnant murky water and attempts to resume the trail He only manages to take a few steps before something feels wrong The headache which had quietly disappeared while talking to the Brook Horse is back in full force and he feels a great pain in his stomach It is as though he is missing some of his body like his insides have been ripped from out of ribs He keeps walking but with each footfall he grows greatly exhausted as if each step were the equivalent of a thousand His body nearly gives up on him entirely forcing him to turn round and gaze at the only entity which could be causing this Though he suspects the B ckah sten the horseman is no longer the only one he sees Cowering beneath a tree shrouded in shadow lies a small child huddled in the fetal position It s soft whimpers and Norwegian language whispers convince Dag he must ignore the urges to write it off as an illusion and investigate Even if it is nothing but a manifestation of his own mind it is precisely that for which he set off on this vision quest He turns fully around and retraces his steps to the adolescent The closer he comes the stranger the feeling in his gut A sense of deja vu He becomes so focused on the child that he hardly notices the chuckling once again coming from the Brook Horse You didn t believe me he softly whispers before his voice trails off His silky equestrian head shakes back and forth Dag slowly approaches the boy He takes notice of the short silky blonde hair on the little one s head plus the ragged clothes and second hand worn out sneakers The young boy s face is concealed as he hugs his knees and whimpers quietly The fractured soul bends down to reach his hand out to comfort the boy The Brook Horse unseen by Dag looks as if he s about to say something but stops and shakes his head again They say seeing is believing he thinks to himself As soon as Dag s fingertip makes contact with the fine strands of blonde hair on the child s head his vision of the world around him begins to convulse uncontrollably Stricken with vertigo Dag s legs beg to give out beneath him but his body is frozen in place Despite the weakness he feels and how dizzy he is his limbs refuse to even move involuntarily He is suspended in time seperate from the fabric of the universe with his gaze locked on the child s head Before his captive eyes the boy s head spins around in a grotesquely contorted motion Staring back at Dagvald is the nightmarish rotting corpse of his own three year old self Liquified pus filled eyeballs droop out of his own skull Maggots squirm and fall from from his nostrils Flies buzz into his gaping lipless jaw Dried blood dots the pitted surface of his skin Layers of dead epidermis molt off of his face The decay of his younger incarnation appears to be occurring at an accelerated rate before his very eyes For the first time in his entire life Dagvald is desperate to scream to succumb to the horror which has seized his soul in an unshakeable deathgrip and unleash his agony unto the world so it may share in his indescribable misery and horror The sound which bursts from his lungs is murderous It seems to set the world spinning even faster as though the chaos of the universe is feeding off of the energy inherent in his unrelenting fear Faced with his own mortality Dagvald slowly slips out of consciousness and into the ethereal world What s left of the child only continues to wither away hideously in real time until almost nothing is left but the yellowed bones which make up a young boy s developing skeleton He is watching himself become a myling a soul sucking creature of ancient folklore Unable to look away Dag is losing himself to insanity Finally having seen enough and unable to stomach anymore the B ckah sten finally intervenes to end the madness He lunges with his powerful equestrian hind legs out of the water lands beside the paralyzed figure and rips his hand away from the decaying skull With contact broken Dagvald regains lucidity and reconnects with the mortal world The sudden return to reality hits him like a truck and finally his body gives out as he collapses to the ground After the horrifying ordeal his breathing is rapid and shallow his pupils dilated and skin paler than the moon I told you mortal but you dismissed me as though I haven t been doing this for hundreds of years the Brook Horse grunts Perhaps now you understand what I mean That boy is an embodiment of that which you must leave behind When you tried to leave me here he refused to go with you Don t you see Do I have to explain every little detail for you to understand what s going on inside your very own mind I can tell you I do not have the patience for such frivolity The Fractured One still reeling from the experience turns to face the Bronco headed figure You you did did this to me he splutters between bated breath He starts to say something else then realizes the terrifying corpse may still be beside him and before he can stop himself he looks back at it out of morbid curiosity Even more shocking than seeing the monstrous cadaver is the fully regenerated boy looking back at him through eyes beaming with childlike wonder as if nothing had ever happened He senses freedom Dagvald It s time you set him free You embarked on this Year Walk to see the future but why bother when you can t let go of the past For as long as you hold onto the sufferings you endured then you torture yourself and your mind will end up just like the moldering abomination I revealed to you I did nothing but open your eyes to your own subconscious Take my hand Dagvald and let him go The tuxedoed chauffeur of the damned extends his arm He Who Walks Two Worlds takes a moment to contemplate the truth behind the Horseman s words Suffering he d been through plenty as a young man Subsistence on low income bullying abuse poor education exposure to traumatising events he d endured it all It has shaped who he is today and partially been a driving force motivating him to prove himself tough enough to make up now for his former weakness in the past Above all of the traumatic experiences he s been through however one in particular sticks out above the rest He begins to think of flames Yellows oranges and reds dance around in his head in a blurry hurricane of color But that was so much later he looks back into the eyes of the younger version of himself There s nothing to show he bears the burden of the fire in those innocent blue eyes he is too young for that But then if not that what is so crucial that he leave behind Maybe Isabella is too important to move beyond her grip too powerful over him her influence too great Or perhaps there is a positive aspect to her hold over him which he must cling to whereas his childhood was an irredeemable hellscape which must be forgotten This Myling never got a chance to be a kid No young man should suffer the way you did Dag thinks to himself He returns his eyes to the B ckah sten hand still outstretched The decision is made He reaches out and firmly grasps the human hand of the half beast This time in contrast to when he touched his own younger self he feels a heavenly relief wash over him As he looks the Brook Horse right in his glass eyes he sees a ghostly perdition of the Myling emanate from his body He feels himself moving backward away from the creature leaving the boy in his place mimicking the stance he held After gaining a few paces distance he stops The shepherd of lost souls leads his innocence by the hand into the depths of the lake until they both vanish from sight completely Chapter Three Lady of the Woods Dag is uneasy walking past the derelict hulks of abandoned locomotives rusting away on disused railroad tracks overgrown by hungry vegetation The juxtaposition of nature and industry is representative of what Dag has been peaching for so long seeing it is almost hard to believe These monstrous hunks of steel once so powerful and resilient integral to civilized society now sit abandoned and overrun by plantlife Mother Nature is fighting an eternal battle to reclaim what is rightfully hers Dag whispers to himself There is a beauty to the abandoned the refuse of man being broken down and returned to nature We have corrupted this realm The scars of man are upon the unnamed wilderness It is my duty to serve justice unto those who commit these grave crimes against nature He bends down to feel one of the steel rails This metal blade which slices into the skin of Fj rgyn is an abomination against our gods He runs his fingers along it until the rust scrapes his skin and causes it to bleed He raises his hand to the shining moon I offer to you O Great Spirit of the Forest but a taste of the blood which shall be shed in your honor Man will pay a great toll for his violations of the sacred oath In it s place I shall forge a blood oath swearing that these sins shall never again wreak havoc upon Midgard The blood drips from his fingers to the ground Slowly drop by drop at first then more and more Before his eyes a faucet of blood is flowing from his hand to the grass below Dagvald is alarmed at his sudden onset of hemophilia and drops to the ground cradling his gushing hand against his chest Now matter how much pressure he applies the blood refuses to stop pouring out of him It follows the contours of the ground and creates a trickling stream from the well worn trail into the woodline The tortured one follows it and is quite surprised by what he sees Leaning against a tree is an astonishingly beautiful woman with long luscious brunette hair With one gorgeous leg she stands barefoot on the ground blood pooling around her foot and vines tickling her ankles With the other she props herself against the tree her bent knee lifting her relatively short and elegant white dress in a flirty fashion Dag s eyes follow the equally elegant curves of this mysterious woman up her body and to her incredibly attractive round face Before he can stop himself he looks directly into those twin deep piercing green eyes She smiles playfully and brings her left hand to her face to blow a kiss and invite him over with a wave of her finger Dag looks down at his hand again and the blood is inexplicably gone completely and his wounds healed He stands up and feels compelled to walk towards the enchantress Who are you He shouts feebly to the mystical woman his legs impatiently carrying him forward not waiting for a response O traveler my name is not important You may simply know me as the pretty young girl you met in the forest Her voice is like an angel singing folk music with heavy reverb Her sweet words echo off the trees and caress Dag s cold body seemingly warming him up How this young lady can be comfortable in the middle of a winter night wearing nothing but a pretty dress must have some supernatural explanation which seems about right to Dag based on his experiences so far Won t you come on over and have a little dance with me boy I think I m a little old to be called boy Dag thinks to himself He is so focused on the young lady ahead of him he doesn t pay any attention to the youthful body he suddenly inhabits Not until he stretches out his hand to take that of the sorceress does he notice he is at least twenty years younger with seemingly no explanation I m sure you hear this a lot but you re a rather handsome gentleman you know that The shy words from the petite woman echo off the trees into the abyss of the uncharted forest The woods now seem to stretch beyond the reach the mortal eye Dagvald feels incredibly lost and awkward surrounded by the unfamiliar terrain and from finding himself in a situation he hasn t been in for decades Not since Isabella has a woman tried to court his fancy This mysterious lady of the forest twirls around and spins into his arms inviting him to allow their bodies closer and closer What is such a fine young man like yourself doing out in the woods at such an hour She begs the obvious question despite already knowing the answer I m I m just out on a walk to clear my mind To enjoy some closeness with nature Oh yes she smiles wide then you ve come to the right girl I can bring you closer to our Great Mother than you ve ever been before She chuckles slyly and flows effortlessly over the tree roots rocks and ferns which usually make it so difficult to walk through the overgrowth She circles Dag and he turns with her though he knows he is certainly not a dancer She senses his unease and uncertainty Daggy boy why are you so nervous How long has it been since you danced with a pretty girl She giggles The heartbroken one begins to answer but realizes he never told the woman his name H how do you know my Oh don t be silly You think I would have invited you into my home this beautiful untouched forest if I didn t know who you are I know a lot about you I know you long for a female companion not to settle down with but to experience the excitement of life with once again Someone as fearless strong willed and crazy as you she giggles again and half covers her face with her hand as shy girls do someone as wholesomely traditionally good looking as you ve always wished for in that boy s brain of yours The mysterious maiden swings around again and Dag feels himself led by her motions and moving to her natural rhythm without even having to think about it He begins to lose himself in this strange ritual He isn t thinking of the future the past or even the true present All he can focus on is this impossibly beautiful brunette staring deep into his soul with her emerald eyes white silk dress flowing in the breeze She is completely in tune with the sounds of the woods around her The birds of prey which stalk the night chirp in melody crickets chink in harmony and frogs croak in unison Even wild deer appear to thud their antlers against the tall trees like drums Let the rhythm of the wild take us Dagvald Let it save us from the monotonous world of man s responsibilities Dance with me boy Let us dance as one spirit deeper into the forest so we may leave the trappings of the modern world behind and return to life as nature intended No pollution no electronic distractions no industrial slaughter of animals Let us be pure as the gods intended She continues her enchanting dance slipping out of Dag s arms and twirling into the forest Follow my voice Dagvald come with me to the place where the heavens meet the Earth As she slips into the ether she sings powerfully in her mesmerizing voice Dag is entranced and can t help but be lured further and further from the trail Finally he emerges in a clearing and his eyes behold the beautiful maiden now standing in a luxurious wedding gown beneath a pair of trees adorned with elegant white ribbons Embrace me Dagvald Riddik Eriksson take my hand in marriage so you may have the traditional woman you have always wanted Here surrounded by nature I offer myself to you as the most loyal and loving woman any man could ever dream of The long heartbroken wanderer finds the offer nigh impossible to resist Before him is a spirit of nature full of unpredictable wonder and unmatchable beauty She is begging him to marry her to fill the void created in him decades ago which still haunts him to this day In the revealing low cut dress she s flaunting her sexual allure is absolutely irresistible After feeling alone and unsatisfied for long Dag simply can t believe his eyes The breasts buttocks and curves on this bewitching temptress simply cannot be passed up by this sexually starved near middle aged man He tenderly walks down the makeshift aisle When he reaches her she smiles and winks at him He stands opposite from her beneath the white ribbons Dag quickly realizes he can hear soft footsteps approaching but he can t take his eyes away from his bride It s just the priestess here to unite us in eternal matrimony my love the spirit whispers as though she read his mind Now the ceremony may begin The black clad woman who has come out of the trees to stand between the new lovers clears her throat opens a book of sermon and begins to preach Dearly beloved Something snaps within Dagvald s mind He whips his head around finally free of the spell placed upon him by the mysterious forest dweller He recognizes that voice even after so long When his eyes meet hers he finds he is not mistaken Isabella My dearest Isabella He tries to grab her by the shoulders and bring her in for a hug but she withers away and floats out of his grasp as though she is a ghost My love don t leave me Don t leave me alone in these woods after so long Isabella just slightly raises her head to peer up at Dag from the top of her eyelids Your love is as fickle as fate Dagvald I thought you loved me but you only loved the role I played in your bizarre fantasy Now I am free and I m here to set you free as well I encourage this marriage so take her hand and I shall pronounce you Man and Huldra Isabella I it s not true My love he tries to speak but the words sputter into nothingness What have I done You He whips back around to face the Huldra I should have known all along You tricked me just as you have so many countless before me Reveal yourself to me vile woman The Huldra laughs loudly with a large playful grin on her face which quickly becomes a sinister smirk You could at least buy me a drink first oh hell it is our wedding night after all She sheds her clothes entirely and can no longer conceal the cow s tail growing out from just above her buttocks Her naked figure glistens in the moonlight an ever tempting forbidden fruit Take me Dagvald Let go of this mortal world and embrace your desires Forget those who forgot you long ago and indulge your lustful needs Are you not a man It takes great mental strength to resist to the enchanting hex of the Huldra A Huldra is another deity from ancient Scandinavian mythology known for luring men into the forest and consuming their emotions until they were an apathetic shell of a man I said reveal yourself to me woman your true self I ve had enough of your games I know you are not that which you portray yourself to be Beneath your illusions you are a hideous abomination I demand you reveal your true self monster With his repeated battle cry Dag draws his sword and prepares to defeat the dark sorceress and free himself from her spells Didn t your mother ever tell you be careful what you wish for As you insist Suddenly a blinding light erupts from the Huldra s back She reaches behind her and peels away her skin like the outer layer of an orange The monster within erupts out of the deceptive human body revealing a monstrous aberration of nature A web of black roots and antlers bursts from the top of it s head There is tree bark covered in moss and fungi where there once was skin Water flows like streams in place of blood veins Spider webs and silk cocoons are wrapped around the twisted fusion of man and wildlife And the face Before he can come to grips with the sheer horror of the abomination s face the Huldra s jaw gapes open like a snake and the blinding light returns completely killing Dag s sight Panicking worried the creature will consume him he charges forward with his sword slicing through the air He hears the scream of the banshee and replies in kind He refuses to show fear He feels like he is running for miles but he never slows down or tires He will not rest until he has the skull of his demonic foe Then whispered quietly but so close against his ear that he can hear it even over his own screaming comes the soft voice of his one and only Daggy my love it s been so long but there is still time Find me Dagvald You must find me I want you to find me Please find me my love Find me Dag s foot collides with a thick tree stump like a mile long coal train colliding with a cliff face He completely collapses and falls on his face bounces and rolls then skids across the ground His vision returns and re realizes the screaming has stopped As the world stops spinning around him he realizes he is back on the trail he set out on for his Year Walk He takes a very long rest to nurse his potentially shattered foot Eventually he forces himself to continue down the path to his future Chapter Four Rise of the Phoenix Finally after what ought to have been an hour journey had turned into several Dagvald emerges out of the trail and onto the rural road in front of Salem Church Only a short distance now separates him from the conclusion to his Year Walk Legends consistently speak of the final vision which most Walkers encounter at the end of their journey Dagvald prepares himself to come face to face with the most complex and feared entities from Swedish folklore As he walks down the secluded unlit concrete road time seems to slow around him He knows sunrise isn t so far off It feels as though he has been enduring this journey for an eternity already The moderate wind which has been threatening to freeze him all night quietly ceases entirely For a moment the world seems to stand still He comes to the driveway splitting off from the road leading to the church He stands for a moment admiring the simplicity of this quaint colonial church in contrast to the extravagant gothic cathedrals of his homeland Still the twin wooden doors are quite imposing He walks up to them stepping lightly over the gravel They are locked of course but the former mercenary came prepared He levels his sight steadies his footing raises his sword and slams it down into the chain fastener It slices about half way through and another blow shreds it off entirely Slowly Dag pushes the two doors open simultaneously They creak loudly as they creep just above the dusty floorboards He forces himself to take the first step across the threshold and into the church Weary traveller calloused and sore time and gravity followed you here A high pitched voice echoes throughout the high ceiling of the church emanating from an as yet unidentified source Rest my brother and tell me all about the fire Dag wants to whip his head around frantically to find the speaker but instead all he can do is keep walking in the darkness Footfall after footfall conveys him to the preacher s podium at the end of the aisle Spontaneously moonlight bursts through the stained glass windows and illuminates the being standing tall on the pulpit At first glance it appears to be the B ckah sten once again But as Dag studies the figure more closely it is revealed to him that atop the well dressed male body is the head of a goat rather than a horse Kyrkogrim he mutters As I was expecting The church grim peers down from his overlook and looks at Dag like a god would peer down at an insect It s ears twitch and eyelids flutter to bat away the flies which try to gather upon it s animalistic portion It s hooves are held aloft arms in the air mimicking the pose of Christ in the painting hung behind it It begins to address Dagvald once again I ve never seen the fire not like you have Something about the voice of this hybrid is genuinely unsettling It s pitch makes Dag recoil and have to fight the instinct to cover his ears knowing it would not make a difference Riches rags famine and feast they matter no more Leave them behind so they shall burden you no longer Standing below me in my House of Christ simply tell me all about the fire It s exceedingly obvious to Dag what the goatman is talking about it What still isn t obvious is how these mythological creatures know so much about him and his past He supposes if they hold the key to his future they must be acquainted with how he gets there What is there which you don t already know I didn t come here to rehash my past I came to see my future Dag projects his voice up into the rafters at the Grim So many have stood where you stand some have lived and some have died As they watched the glass of sand the grains fell which marked the time For some journeys were just beginning but for others they reached their ending I don t have time for such nonsensical rambling goat You know what I m here for so give it to me and I ll be on my way Dag shouts his temper short as the hours without sleep being to pile up You think I know what you want from me How can I when you don t even know yourself Drop the riddles animal I know exactly what I want I want your heart So it s vision you seek the goat states unperturbed You have heard that my heart holds the key to seeing into the future You are one of many but the first in a long time Many have tried many have failed What makes you think you are different Why do you deserve to see the future through Odin s eye Dag looks directly into the eyes of the Grim and confidently exclaims because Odin has chosen me personally I am the prophesied one The one who will salvage the creation of the gods from the brink of damnation and lead us to salvation If you try to deny me this rite then you are commiting no more sacrilegious act than defying the very will of the gods so give me your heart or Odin shall guide my blade to cut it out of you Dag draws his sword for the third time tonight ready to carry out his threat The Kyrkogrim is unimpressed however With a dull look in his alien like goat eyes he responds as he walks down the steps from the pulpit They call you He Who Walks Two Worlds but which worlds are those You believe it is the mortal realm and the realm of the gods Of course you walk amongst the living but what if you also walk amongst the dead and damned Who are you to know that you deserve the blessing of our lords Odin himself has spoken to me Dag indignantly spits the words He has shown me great visions beyond that which any other man has seen in our time Do not doubt my holiness when your head is that of Beelzebub You inhabit this house of the desert cult and you dare claim to speak for our true All Father Having reached the bottom of the steps the Church Grim walks casually up to Dagvald and brushes aside his sword with the thick hardened skin of his hoof He looks the frustrated mortal in the eyes and says I am a fusion of the ancient traditions with the new Only in an entity cursed with the duality of twin religions can the key to omniscience be manifested The gods and God our Lord have entrusted me with this Knowledge and me alone and you come wandering in here lost expecting it to set you on your path Mortal it has been centuries since the last of your kind approached me Therefore I am willing to allow you that which you request if for nothing more than the opportunity to entertain myself Step forward and look into the fabric of time The Kyrkogrim hooks his hooves and opens the black cloak in which he is clad The parting of his dark robes reveals a truly disturbing sight Just as legends told the heart of a Church Grim is crystalline yet organic exposed and pulsating Dagvald comes closer to the devilish being unsure if he is prepared for what he is about to witness He raises his hand palm outstretched and reaches to place it lightly upon the beating organ Finally he makes contact and to his astonishment Nothing changes He does not have any visions he does not gain any heightened sense of awareness of knowledge he simply remains standing in this old church Frustrated he slightly tightens his grip on the heart carefully at first When he feels how rock solid the crystalline object is he confidently grasps it firmly but still nothing changes He grows more and more aggravated and tries to shout at the Grim but his words won t leave his mouth He is so focused on the goat headed beast that it takes several minutes before the smell registers in his conscious Faint at first and slowly stronger as time continues to pass Minutes later Dagvald realizes it is accompanied by a crackling sound Refusing to take his hand off the heart he looks around to identify the source of these sensory stimulants Joining hearing and smell is sight as he notices a glowing flickering light behind the podium on the pulpit It shines brightly on the face of Jesus Christ hanging eternally crucified for man s sins on the wall of the church The popping and growling noise sooty ashy smell and flickering oranges and yellows finally add up to an equation Dag can solve He panics and tries to take his hand off the Grim s heart but it feels cemented in place No matter how hard he tries he cannot free himself In his frustration he looks up to assault the Grim gut those goat eyes are no longer there to stare back at him with their glassy beady look Nothing but the hardened heart remains floating suspended air as fire grows and begins to consume the body of Christ from the toes up He cannot escape and he cannot scream He exists outside of time and betwixt the fabric of the worlds itself The knowledge Dagvald sought is overwhelming him with no sign of relief It continues to grow and spread devouring every wooden plank the church is built of and using it as fuel to increase its destructive capability exponentially It creeps along the walls slowly encircling its victim which is unable to escape Dag remains frozen in place despite the incinerating heat causing him to lose hydration through the sweat gushing out of his body The flames creep closer and closer yet still Dag cannot release himself from the floating heart He feels the burn of the fire as it licks at his skin like kisses from his hound dog The searing pain would be enough to make him pass out if he were truly conscious Instead he is not spared of the unimaginable horror in such a merciful fashion He is forced to remain fully aware as his skin melts from his muscle and his muscle falls of his bone like a well cooked cajun chicken wing In his last living moments the Chosen One accepts his fate As he lives long past that which any mortal could possibly survive when suffering the indescribable unfathomable pain of burning alive he thinks of Valhalla and Hel and wonders if he has died honorably attempting to fulfill his destiny Even in the worst case scenario he thinks I only have to wait until Ragnarok to redeem my failure In short order his brain and sentience shut down as the last remnants of his being are consumed by fire and crushed by falling debris Later The residents living in nearby homes along the road were made aware of the fire by the unpleasant smell of smoke and the crashing of wood falling from the ceiling Fire crews and first responders arrived as soon as possible though some time had certainly elapsed before their arrival because of the relative isolation of this rural community The ruins of the church are marked by nearly nothing still managing to stand Fire trucks douse the inferno with water and sand taking nearly half an hour to full extinguish the raging fire As the firemen cautiously make their way through the wreckage to inspect it for possible causes and any casualties they find nothing suspicious or alarming There are no potential causes immediately identifiable and no bodies of victims to be found It s like it just magically burst into flames says one fireman bewilderedly to another As they discuss the case a female raven swoops down and perches atop a smoldering plank The blackbird is unperturbed by the heat still radiating off the moist board It ruffles its feathers and cleans between them It sits quietly watching the cleanup efforts around it It suddenly feels a lump in its throat and starts to cough in an attempt to clear it Something is moving in its chest threatening to burst out The bird coughs and coughs heaving its chest greatly After great effort something begins to emerge from its beak Out of the little bird breaks free a great flaming Phoenix Enlarged by the huge entity it released unto the world the raven now stands as tall as the fiery fowl Its wings are skeletal and its beak sharp and pointed The humans are aghast at the sight they behold The Nattravnen and the Phoenix begin to dance together in the early morning darkness looping around each other very low to the ground weaving between the mortals as they fly With each pass some men lit ablaze by the phoenix some men are cast with disease by the Nattravnen and collapse to the ground They assert themselves with little effort over the pitifully weak beings that make up the human race To them these men are like worms to pluck from the ground on a rainy morning They treat this world as their playground wrecking their havoc upon it with disregard for those who suffer beneath them Soon all who witness the two beasts have been rendered helpless by their black mysticism On the peak of the charred church they both perch proudly Looking down to survey the destruction which they have wrought they caw loudly with glee Turning to each other they gaze into their eyes A being of fire rebirth and power accompanied by a being of death disease and suffering Naturally they kiss in celebration of the newfound power they wield With this joining of beaks they extinguish the sun and set a plague of their own fire upon the world

4461,4461,"Falcons training camp is into full swing and it looks like the team already has some good news. Multiple reporters noted that starting free safety Ricardo Allen was on the practice field with his helmet. Given the nature of Ricardo‚Äôs injury from 2018, it‚Äôs incredibly encouraging to see him on the field. It‚Äôs even more encouraging to see him with his helmet, a sign that he won‚Äôt just be participating peripherally. As we noted before, Dan Quinn has said he believes both Ricardo Allen and Keanu Neal will be good to go for training camp, but serious questions remained. For Neal, the recovery time for ACL injuries is anywhere between 9 to 12 months. With Ricardo, achilles injuries are even trickier, and the track record of previous NFL athletes making it back to 100% is not great. That said, we‚Äôre hopeful that Allen will bounce back this year though he‚Äôs definitely a player we‚Äôll be keeping an eye on throughout camp and the preseason. At minimum, it‚Äôs good to see him out there and we hope this is a sign of things to come. More From The Falcoholic"

Given that yours is the first post in this thread since 2018, I think we can take it that this isn't a common problem. As your camera is out of warranty, the repair estimate you've been given sounds pretty fair to me. It's probably just the fuse. To replace them, they only need to disassemble the bottom plate, the back cover, the side covers, the front cover, the top cover, the main board, the image sensor, the front body / mirror box, the shutter unit, the shutter actuator and the power board."

I sort of assume, when using with a DSLR, the end point would be on the sensor plane. Is the start point on the flat of flange on the objective? (For interest really as in practice it seems to work with a range of tube lengths.) Thanks. This is the distance you want the finite objective lens from the sensor plane as mentioned. The DSLR camera body lens mounting flange to sensor distance varies, Nikon is 46.5mm I recall. So you would want the objective lens mount flange of the lens to be 160-46.5mm from the Nikon camera lens mount flange. Finite objectives I'm familiar with (AmScope 4X, Lomo 3.7) are not highly sensitive to this distance, and you can use this distance to change the magnification over a small range. With a bellows this can become a simple limited range zoom (highly convenient). Infinite objectives are another case, requiring a separate ""tube"" lens. Hope this helps, Best,"

2847,2847,"trnfncb11 wrote: I notice some undocumented (to the best of my knowledge) and confusing interaction between face-detection (FD) and the selection of OVF or EVF. I hope somebody can clarify. First question: if I turn on FD, the photometry icon in the LCD (and in the EVF) gets replaced by the appropriate FD/eye-detection icon. The photometry menu icon is disabled and so is any Fn button assigned to photometry. This is the expected behaviour, so far so good. But if I now switch to the OVF, I see again the photometry icon instead of the FD/ED icon. Is this a bug? Furthermore, if I now switch on the ERF, the photometry icon turns YELLOW, and the Fn button assigned to photometry is active again, allowing me to change the metering mode. What does this all mean? Is FD only working in conjunction with the EVF? Second related question (X100V): A Fn button assigned to switching FD on/off appears to work only if I look at the LCD or have the EVF on. If I'm composing in OVF, the Fn button is inactive. What gives? I'm pretty new to the X100V so was waiting to see if anyone else would respond here, nothing so far so let me contribute my thoughts. FD is not available when using the OVF, only the EVF or back LCD. When using FD, the camera meters for the face and removes the options to change photometry / metering mode. It appears that if you switch to OVF mode with FD enabled the camera just enables matrix metering. Because of this, changes to the FD confirmation in the display and use of an assigned function button will vary depending on whether you are using the OVF or not. I don't think this is particularly clear in the manual though I have jumped around in it rather than reading cover to cover, it does seem logical though. The ERF is a bit of an anomaly, either programers decided that in this view mode, they would give the ability to change metering mode - I would say this is a bug as it doesn't seem logical behaviour although it is consistent."

3165,3165,"[QUOTE=""darrens1, post: 17552620, member: 345001""] Sticking a cam in + exhaust + ramp would appeal to me although I'd be worried about the cam removing the smooth nature of tbe engine? Pennies might be an issue too.. T [/QUOTE] With large overlaps and traditional carbs or some PFI, fuel passes into the exhaust manifold and ignites, creating the characteristic ""lumpiness"" at tick - over. Racers would be continually blipping their throttles to avoid the engine stalling. It all seems so romantic now, nostalgic for the good old days, when we could get away with anything. And I don't suppose it would do cats any good, or meet emissions regulations. However, and I can't think the 1.9 or 2.2 JTS engines differ too much from the principles employed with JTS technology. The beauty is, being ""Direct Injection"", the designers can choose when the fuel is injected. And indeed can be variable depending upon what they want to achieve. In the case of the Alfa JTS, valve timing in conjunction with fuel injection timing and piston design appear to be fundamental to meeting emissions at low revs. So the fuel is injected at or near TDC on the compression stroke, utilizing stratified ""Stratified Charge Techniques"". Therefore, no fuel can appear in the exhaust manifold during the valve overlap period. Essentially, you could have as big an overlap as mechanical interference allows - or should I say lack of allows. Lean to ultra lean burn appears to be utilized at low revs, which accounts, I believe for the relative gutlessness at idle/2k. But, I think, the amount fuel injected at or near top dead centre is calibrated against the MAF figure the ECU sees. So with the my CB cams now introducing 23.5 deg. PVO and the extended duration of 278 degrees, I think the mixture ratio remains the same, but the volume is greater. Either way, there is no obvious signs that there may be a set of performance camshafts on my engine as the tick over is rock - steady at 750 rpm."

8239,8239,"Black walnut wood soap . About 30 years ago, a very young me helped my dad to plant 1000 walnut trees around an older walnut tree that was planted by my grandfather roughly 30 years before that (you can see this older tree in the last video). Through the years, these trees became a luxuriant wood that gave (and still gives) shelter to wildlife, and also to myself when I needed quietness and solitude ‚Äì which happened very often. I've always admired walnut trees for the beauty of their crowns, the shades and tones of their wood grains, the generosity of their rich and tasty nuts and especially for the fact that they 'were' always there for me. . This soap is my homage to the walnut wood (I added 2 pictures of actual walnut wood in the post). To achieve the desired color palette, I've only used vegetable additives (among which: madder root infused olive oil, anatto infused almond oil, indigo infused olive oil, birch leaves and rosehip) . Olive oil Coconut oil Shea butter Roce Bran oil Castor oil Almond oil Cocoa butter . bergamot, rosemary, lemon, peppermint . with madder root, annatto seeds, indigo, birch leaves, oatmeal, kaolin clay, green clay, rosehip. .

8309,8309,"I think it all comes down to your expected rate of return. If I pay 2.5%, but I value each MR point (that I transfer to Aeroplan or whatever) to be worth more than 2.5 - 5c each, I am still getting a good return! Personally I get 7-8 cpp worth on my MR after transferring them, so even if factoring in the 2.5% on foreign currency, I am still netting a lot more than 1.5-2% in cash-back. Of course this is really a YMMV kinda thing, and depends on the redemptions you are able to do. Churning or keeping is really a question of what you value the perks and other elements of the card for. I am of course a big fan of the products and offerings, so it obviously affects my perspective, but I think they can be also good ""keepers"" if you fit a certain profile. Even after my big trip, I am still planning to keep the Platinum card and have the Rogers WE as my non-amex spend card. As for your destinations, I think you can be well-served by Aeroplan indeed. Thai Airways and Air India are both Star Alliance members, and the YQ on Aeroplan is low. Unless it all switches to dynamic pricing, they can be good value as fixed mileage redemptions. Avios could also work (opening RBC cards as an option, though once again 2.5% FX), but again it really varies between redemptions. No program is perfect, and the value one derives really depends on travel habits, timing and destination.

5905,5905,I have Never Seen Anything Like This Small Businesses Beg For Speedy Stimulus Delivery I have never seen anything like this in my lifetime one small business owner was cited in Reuters as saying The real question now is how long can small and family businesses which account for some half of all US employment and are fast blowing through whatever cash remains many say they are good for no more than two weeks wait till they actually feel the effects of the trillion stimulus package After all it could take weeks to process checks and get loans out and yet April remains essentially cancelled Without something we wouldn t be able to keep our employees another business owner with just five employees said My biggest goal is to keep them and of course make sure there s a business for them to come back and work for Congress trillion includes billion meant to rescue small firms through the Payroll Protection Program intended for businesses to cover eight weeks of payroll and basic operating expenses via a forgivable loan of up to million which companies of up to employees or fewer can access available through June Via ABC News This as retail stores have already shuttered in just over a week nationwide with no clear re opening date resulting in over workers on furlough based on Bloomberg data also as new soaring unemployment numbers come out weekly with last week the Labor Department reporting a record million people filing unemployment insurance claims in the week prior Speed is the operative word spokesman for the specific Treasury Dept agency the Small Business Administration SBA which is to oversee getting the funds to businesses Jovita Carranza said And CEO of the Bank Policy Institute Greg Baer pointed out that This is the kind of program that in ordinary times would take a year to get started Indeed as details and crucial processing elements on the rollout continue to come into focus investors will remain wary of bottlenecks which would detract from the economic upside given that ensuring as many firms as possible remain operating in the wake of the outbreak is vital to preserving as much of the previously robust employment market as possible We noted last week that now with the stimulus passed into law it s precisely this next hurdle of speed and timeliness which will be as great if not greater than the first and presents a significant degree of execution risk There are several aspects of the proposed stimulus measures which have well established distribution channels unemployment benefits and the injection of cash directly to households As for the corporate small business and state local government allocations this leg of the process presents a greater challenge There s a fair amount of money Yale University finance professor Andrew Metrick told Bloomberg this week But ultimately we have capacity problems getting the money into the hands of the small businesses fast enough without fraud or bad actors effectively figuring out how to siphon money off Via National Restaurant Association And Reuters adds further on the question of timing Banks have been telling customers to be patient and asking them to get relevant paperwork ready so that loans are processed quickly when it all comes together Some expect cash to begin moving as soon as Friday In short there s the classic question of speed vs qualitative oversight Either the government gives everyone what they want without checking leaving the potential to unleash unprecedented fraud or they do a meticulous check of everything and businesses fail during the long wait in limbo But the following does not lend toward optimism The White House is dispatching staff to the Small Business Administration as that agency struggles with a flood of requests for financial aid according to people familiar with the matter So many people tried to access one SBA loan program last week that the agency s website failed repeatedly Mnuchin has vowed to have the small business loan program up and running by the end of the week Via Brookings Sifan Liu and Joseph Parilla observe that small business particularly newer ones were hit hardest during the recession As the economy continues to suffer impacts from coronavirus induced measures they look back at what happened to such businesses then In of the largest metro areas they find small businesses were responsible for more than of the net job loss But assuming we are still having this discussion into next week and possibly the next after and as confused business owners struggle to fight through the red tape it is sure to be too late for many who are still paying the bills today only on revenue from yesterday or rather from two weeks ago This last week we ve been working diligently with our banker to keep every single cash reserve dollar we ve got to take care of things we absolutely have to pay until some of these loan programs become available and we can get cash out of them Jerry

A preamble is literally the policy frame that surrounds the canvas of the law. GenSec has used the preamble to clarify resolutions before. If you want to make the pitch that MD doesn't apply, then the proposal has the issue of fitting into no category. The only support in the preamble for the moral decency is that the existence of moral concerns regarding stem cell research exists, as I noted. The preamble then goes on to say that, despite these concerns, the World Assembly ought not impede this research, but, ""preserve the safety and freedom of those involved,"" That is not moral decency. That is bioethics. Separatist Peoples wrote:But, since nations are given explicit opportunity to limit the individual freedoms of researchers by terminating embryonic stem cell research, due to the theoretically controversial nature of such research, I'm having a hard time seeing MD as inappropriate. Nations are given dick, they already have the opportunity to do that, and as I said before that clause also prevents the world assembly banning embryonic stem cell research for moral reasons. So it's hardly support for the moral decency category. You might want to make the point of actually reading the post you are replying to before throwing shade. OOC: Unfortunately, I have to read every post, regardless of quality. I pointed out the interpretation of the rules I plan on applying. The proposal legalizes a small part of a field of research, and gives member states the power to restrict the overwhelming majority of the rest of it. That's MD. Done and done. Bioethics protects subjects of experimentation based on the text of the description. This doesn't do that. It is not a legal option."

Go ahead and start the chain again early if you're low on health without Larsa's USB ready. All spare SB gauge entrusts go to Larsa. Make sure Astra is up at all times and if it isn't, don't be afraid to use the USB even though you don't need healing. Most of my lost runs were because of Black Cauldron with no Astra. Basically if you see Savage Strike or Black Cauldron, get Astra back up ASAP. Most of the time I just Wrath'd with Larsa and Entrusted from Quina and waited for one of these to hit, then used the USB. I tried a few setups with characters with Last Stand which was helpful, but I couldn't do enough damage to beat Doom even though my survivability went way up. More Assault Sabre hones and getting a 4* Magicite Physical Holy deck would make this fight less stressful. The deck I took was junk (only 2 99 Isgebinds are halfway noteable).

2217,2217,The latest Bachelor Nation memoir comes from Amanda Stanton whose book Now Accepting Roses digs in deep on her life before during and after her time once on The Bachelor and twice on Bachelor in Paradise Viewers first met Stanton a single mother of two on Ben Higgins season of The Bachelor When that did not work out Stanton gave Bachelor in Paradise Season a chance It was there that she got engaged to Josh Murray One messy public breakup later Stanton returned for Bachelor in Paradise Season where she met Robby Hayes None of her Bachelor Nation romances lasted but now Stanton is sharing her side of the relationships in her book She dives in deepest on her romance with Murray writing of the behavior he allegedly exhibited that ultimately resulted in her terminating the relationship She also addresses major moments in Bachelor in Paradise history like her thoughts on Dean Unglert s love triangle with Kristina Schulman and Danielle Lombard as well as her perspective on the production shutdown in Season And while the book is not percent about Bachelor Nation Stanton gives travel tips mom advice fashion help and more the book does reveal a lot about the behind the scenes of filming the franchise that fans may not know Now Accepting Roses by Amanda Stanton Producers Are Really Serious About Bachelor Contestants Not Meeting Each Other Before The Show Stanton said that on Higgins season before the contestants got in the limos for the premiere they were put in different corners of the hotel lobby each facing a wall so that they did not get too friendly before the cameras had started rolling Once They d Met Most Contestants Were Friendly About Sharing Clothes Accessories And Makeup The contestants are in charge of their own hair and makeup for the show and so they also shared grooming and application expertise to make sure everyone was camera ready The twins Emily and Haley Ferguson were sweet about doing girls hair and makeup Stanton said And Lauren Bushnell was so great with other peoples s eyebrows we called her makeshift station Lauren s Brow Bar The Downtime Between Dates Could Get Boring We d basically sit around all day waiting to be part of the show Stanton recalled adding We d paint our nails nap pretty much just hang There s not a lot for contestants to do while filming the show since books TV and other forms of entertainment are forbidden Those Glamorous World Travel Locales Are not Actually That Fun Sure the Bachelor or Bachelorette may be exploring places like Scotland Italy or the Bahamas with a handful of one on one date contestants but not everyone is lucky enough to go on those That means all the contestants who are not picked for those dates are locked in their hotel rooms for the duration of the trip That s right the hotel room Even the beach pool and gym are off limits Stanton said She added that being at the airport was their only chance at contact with people and things outside of producers and the show so they would go wild at airport shops We could finally swipe our cards to buy something Stanton wrote It was silly how much we missed simple things such as making a purchase All The Contestants Have To Re Pack Their Bags Before Every Rose Ceremony Stanton said that rose ceremonies can happen about every three days so everyone is constantly packing and unpacking She was very serious about everything she packed for the show and planned outfits out ahead of time Part of the way Stanton organized her luggage was in priority outfits that she wanted to wear ASAP in case she got sent home early and then second option outfits in case she lasted longer She even labeled certain ensembles as rose ceremony group date and more Basically she s organized AF and she goes into even more packing tips in the book Stanton Experienced A Huge Social Media Jump On The Bachelor It s no secret that Instagram has changed the game for reality TV with many stars returning from a show and hopping into a career in social media Stanton did the same likely because she went from followers to when she was announced as a contestant to overnight when she was eliminated from Higgins season These days she s at million followers In Contrast To The Bachelor Bachelor In Paradise Is Way Less Structured It is almost like being on an actual vacation Stanton wrote You can wake up whenever you like on most days Producers will put a mic on you and then you are free to do whatever you want The Producers Have Clever Tactics For Recording Contestants At All Times Many a contestant has spent time in the ocean perhaps in an attempt to have a private conversation since they can not wear their mics in the water But the producers have thought of everything As soon as producers see two people out in the waves they get their longest microphones and stick them out as far as they can get them Stanton said Dates Are Planned Super Last Minute On BiP Because contestants are in charge of handing out the date cards to whomever they want things are a little unorganized On the show I had about a minute s notice for one on one dates so last minute that I barely had any time to get ready Stanton wrote That s the reason why most people just go in the clothes they were already wearing It s from the time they get the date card to when the date begins Stanton Tried To Leave Paradise With Murray But Producers Were not Having It When Nick and Josh got into a fight on the beach Josh and I discussed leaving Stanton revealed about her time on BiP Season The couple had figured they d already found what they d come there for why stay for the drama But Stanton said the producers offered them a date at a hotel if they stayed and the chance to get some air conditioning and alone time won them over Murray Brought His Mom To The Fantasy Suite Viewers did not see this part but Stanton said that after she and Murray spent time in the Fantasy Suite Murray s mom showed up to meet Stanton ahead of Murray proposing to her The fact that we were all meeting at the Fantasy Suite an intimate location where he and I just spent the night together felt more than a little inappropriate Stanton wrote Stanton Did not Feel Pressured To Say Yes To Murray s Proposal In fact she felt the opposite Nobody was encouraging me to say yes If anything the producers were telling me not to Stanton said They d ask me if I was sure this was something I wanted to do At the time it was but Stanton writes in her book all about why that decision was ultimately a mistake Even through the lowest lows though Stanton said she does not regret joining this franchise Going on The Bachelor was the craziest yet most vulnerable thing I have ever done It was the first time in a long time I made myself step out of my box she wrote And because she stepped outside that box fans have a whole bunch of new BTS information about this wacky but beloved reality TV dating franchise and a cautionary tale about bringing

10586,10586,Episodes three and four of The Last Dance aired on Sunday night and somehow even catapulted above the greatness of the first two episodes The ESPN Netflix documentary looks at the season of the Chicago Bulls the last time the team won a title with Michael Jordan Scottie Pippen Phil Jackson and Dennis Rodman A big reason for these episodes greatness was that they largely focused on Rodman a figure who s as misunderstood and interesting as any athlete of the last few decades We ll do a full breakdown of the two episodes later this morning but for now let s count down the best six moments featuring Rodman in the episode from his on court work to his infamous trip to Las Vegas with Carmen Electra Rodman explaining the rebounding prep work he did Dennis Rodman was statistically the greatest rebounder the game has ever seen Read this wonderful extensive blog post breaking down just how special he was As he reveals in the documentary that wasn t just from some preternatural understanding of where the ball was going to go Rodman reveals that he used to go in an empty gym and has his friends chuck up shots from all over the court over and over so he could study how the ball would bounce He d have them shoot with different arcs and spins and revealed that he d study certain players releases to know how the ball would come off the rim of their shots If one thing became even more clear these episodes Good heavens he did the work Getting a bill from Craig Sager for an upcoming fine There s a delightful moment when a younger Craig Sager is walking past Rodman in the underbelly of an arena and Sager hands Rodman a bill to help him pay some upcoming undisclosed fine Rodman laughs then posits it s Sager bribing him for an upcoming interview The Barbara Walters interview Watching Rodman s interview with Barbara Walters interview back is such an interesting little window into the time period Walters is such a tough interviewer that she doesn t let Rodman off the hook but watching back it s sort of bizarre what she won t let him off the hook for He dyes his hair He has piercings Who cares There s a longer essay here about why Rodman was so threatening to people back then and what it says about popular athletes especially popular black athletes that any deviation from a preset idea results in a national hysteria His apology to Michael Jordan After getting ejected from a game Dennis Rodman apologized to Michael Jordan by going to his room and asking if he had an extra cigar No sorry or anything Just asking for a cigar That s great but what s even better is that MJ inherently understood that was Rodman s way of apologizing and forgave him Honestly it made me like Jordan more The Vegas vacation Rodman asked for a vacation to clear his head and was given hours to go to Las Vegas and blow off steam It s incredible how much respect Phil Jackson gave his stars by the way Not only in allowing Rodman to go but by getting Jordan s permission first I d heard that story before What I hadn t heard or forgot was that the Bulls actually sent Jordan to go collect Rodman in Las Vegas Can you imagine if that happened today NBA Twitter would have to retire His dismissal of Nashville This was a throwaway line and Nashville has changed a lot and I love the city so please don t get mad at me for including it But when a fan told Dennis he needed to come visit Nashville his answer I ve been to Nashville Uh uh No is an all timer

medicine it needs time to work for CBD to start out working To be able to deliver its advantages CBD first has to be consumed into our bloodstream When within the bloodstream it may then be distributed through the Endocannabinoid System where in actuality the receptors that are cannabinoid CBD can bond using the receptors in our human anatomy The relationship between these receptors could be the catalyst behind the countless great things about CBD Returning towards the subject at hand how very long does the consumption process simply just take as soon as are you going to begin experiencing the many benefits of CBD The quick response is it differs according to a few key factors the usage technique the high quality and style of CBD as well as your body s fat rate of

will go through different digestive functions of y our human body deteriorating and filtering the CBD as you go along With regards to the dosage of CBD you are taking just a share actually reaches the bloodstream Your usage technique not merely impacts exactly just how much CBD reaches the bloodstream it affects just just how quickly the CBD are certain to get here Less digestive functions to

7858,7858,For many of us the Toronto International Film Festival is a chance to enjoy a night on the town check out some buzzy movies and hopefully have a meet cute with Michael B Jordan But for the celebs publicists makeup artists hair stylists and hundreds of others hustling behind the scenes the festival is a grind albeit a fun one We asked some of TIFF s insiders to spill on how they spent their busiest hours Today a director of publicity and promotions talks about hand holding celebrities through TIFF I have been in publicity for six years and in film for I work for a film distribution company we buy a movie and then we do publicity for it This year we have a handful of TIFF films that we are hosting junkets for junkets include interviews premieres and parties I am responsible for making sure the festival runs as smoothly as possible I make sure the talent the film s stars or director is happy while they are under our responsibility so that in turn they do the press Sometimes it s as simple as approving a manicure and pedicure we paid for a high profile actress whose team requested it this happened this weekend Another time talent asked me for a B12 shot because he was feeling sick so I had to track down a doctor and approve the addition to our budget I call myself a glorified babysitter because my team of and I have to schedule everything even when talent go to the bathroom in order to make sure a junket day goes smoothly Every second counts The other day I was literally picking up plates from a talent s lunch At the same time I am like Hi I am the director of publicity Generally a celebrity will do a day of press and the premiere at night Some actors will say I am only doing four hours of press So fit in what you can but I am not going to work outside that window You would think that the Mark Wahlbergs and J Los of the world would be the most demanding but A list talent like them know their job and know what they are there for The C listers are new and so excited to do whatever you need and they do not question anything They are great The problem in general is the B listers They are about to launch but they also know they are not nobodies so they push boundaries with you Some will demand Well Julia Roberts got that why do not I get that And you are like Because you are not Julia Roberts I worked with one actress when she was in town for TIFF for an indie film She was amazing and did everything she could to promote the movie The next year we had her again for another film In the meantime she had been signed to a blockbuster franchise and won some awards and it was a completely different experience We went from literally hugging at the end of the press junket to her saying I am not doing this photo in front of that step and repeat It s not what I want to do How much a celebrity wants to promote a movie also depends on the status of the film whether it s been picked up for distribution or already has a release date For example Hustlers is coming out on Friday The reason why J Lo did everything and was willing to do it all the interviews the studios the Instagramming is because this was her premiere before the release on Friday and what she captures here is going to help her with its success Some stars just do what they want Last year one person smoked in his hotel room He did not listen when we asked him not to We ended up paying the bill to clean it It was Sometimes you get surprises like I am bringing my dog and we have to reach out to the airline and then tell the hotel and then pay for the hotel cleanup fee because the dog has to come and god forbid we say no and all of sudden the actor will not do press with us Change happens constantly We have had to change so many flights because people can not decide whether they want to leave today or tomorrow Maybe Shia LaBeouf for example invites them to a party or to see his movie and they decide to stay On a typical day interviews will usually wrap by p m and then talent gets a break from before they head to the premiere Every celebrity has his or her own car we hire a fleet of drivers You can not put them in the same car even though they are often going to the same place When celebrities are on their afternoon break it s time for me to change for the premiere I prep all of my outfits before TIFF because I never have time during the festival Every day has a hanger with a day outfit and a night outfit Publicists rule is you generally wear black all the time for anything even on the red carpet In the past I have had a stylist I am not in the limelight but I am in the same space so you have to look put together a little bit I went for a blow dry on Wednesday knowing I probably will not be washing my hair the next three days As for makeup the celebrity groomers are usually on their break in the afternoon and hanging around so they will touch me up I will sit at my computer answering last minute premiere ticket and party requests everyone comes crawling out of the woodwork while getting my hair and makeup done When it s time for the premiere I have to be on the red carpet to help put out fires and receive talent and executives but once the movie starts I have a little break Most talent will not stay to watch the movie They come back to do the Q A At this point if the premiere is near Roy Thomson Hall us publicists head over to Elephant Castle pub for a quick dinner Then it s back to the premiere and the after party My TIFF rule is one drink per party Mind you if you asked me that three years ago that would not have been the case Now I can not function with too much alcohol I generally stay at a party until the talent leaves Saturday night I was out until a m but the latest I have stayed at a party is until a m only to be in the office by a m the next day Like what you see How about some more R29 goodness right here A Bartender Reveals What Goes Down At TIFF Parties A Day In The Life Of A Celeb Hair Stylist At

114,114,The British Airways A350 Club Suite Experience Index to Genius1 Trip Reports The summer of might now feel like a distant and rather fond memory but it was July of last year that British Airways took delivery of the first of of their long awaited new flagship aircraft the Airbus A350 Introduced primarily to replace the Boeing Queen of the Skies on selected longhaul routes over the space of several summer months BA operated their new A350 fleet to Madrid for crew familiarisation and training with flights scheduled as regular commercial services This report details a brief one night excursion to Spain s capital city in August the sole purpose being to experience BA s newest aircraft and their much anticipated new Club World seat the all aisle access Club Suite on both sectors I ll also include here a brief review of my home for the night the Crowne Plaza Madrid Airport LHR MAD As is often the case when departing from one of the T5 satellites and not having access to the Concorde Room after lunch I chose to spend the bulk of the wait before this afternoon s flight in the Galleries Club lounge in T5B this is usually a much quieter retreat than the Galleries First lounge in T5A and today offered the added bonus of a fairly clear view across the taxiway of my ride to Madrid the aptly registered G XWBA This is BA s first A350 and at the time of travelling was the only A350 in the fleet until joined by G XWBB the following month Gate C56 in T5C offered a cracking close up view of today s aircraft note the UK flag livery on the inside winglets together with a glimpse of the Negus liveried in the distance at T5B Despite C56 being equipped with three airbridges designed for A380 use only one airbridge was connected to the aircraft today at Door L This didn t stop the gate node information display screen signposting passengers in Rows the forward cabin to use the unconnected forward airbridge which caused a small amount of confusion for some passengers ahead of me Although BA no longer check boarding passes at the aircraft door on narrowbody aircraft widebodies are still blessed with this practice presumably due to multiple entry doors and aisles and so I was welcomed at the door by name and directed to the left into the A350 s forward cabin As I headed to Seat A my initial impression of the cabin was one of understated sophistication the cabin felt distinctly British Airways but with a modern fresh and exciting edge In a smart design feature each of the Club Suites included the seat number alongside the British Airways Speedmarque on the exterior of the seat It was immediately clear that today s cabin and flight crew were very proud of the new aircraft personal seat side welcomes from the cabin crew were made normally a Qatar Airways staple but rarely a BA feature outside of First cabins along with tours of the Club Suite and a mention of the aircraft s special status in multiple flight and cabin crew announcements BA are phasing out safety videos on their narrowbody fleet in favour of a shorter manual safety demonstration this is mainly due to newer narrowbody aircraft being delivered without overhead screens but also better accommodates shorter taxiways from the gate to the active runway Safety videos continue to be a feature on widebody aircraft all of which are equipped with personal video screens at every seat in every cabin Despite this for unconfirmed reasons but potentially training related ones today s safety demonstration was a manual one As we pushed back from the gate we rolled past the most elegant of BA s aircraft the BOAC liveried parked at T5B Each Club Suite is equipped with a shoulder harness in addition to the regular lap seatbelt this additional harness must be worn during taxi takeoff and landing but not inflight when the seatbelt sign is on Unlike in the same seat on Qatar Airways British Airways do not allow any item to be placed on the seat s side ledge outside of a compartment during taxi takeoff and landing although a handbag or similar can be placed all the way under the footrest BA s initial batch of A350s are being delivered in a class configuration featuring Club World seats Club Suites in a layout spread across two cabins of eleven and three rows World Traveller Plus seats in a layout in a single cabin of seven rows and World Traveller seats in a layout spread across two cabins of six and twenty rows At just six seats less but with far greater fuel efficiency this configuration most closely resembles the Mid J configured albeit without a First cabin on the initial A350s at least Originally introduced years ago and last majorly updated years ago BA have rightly long been maligned for their ageing Club World seat Lacking storage direct aisle access and privacy in the majority of seats this seat has not been competitive for many years And so years in the making BA took the opportunity of the introduction of the A350 to their fleet to debut the replacement hard product for their longhaul business class cabins the Club Suite Shunning a bespoke design for the first time in years BA have opted for a modified version of the excellent and now widely used Collins Aerospace Super Diamond product as the base for the Club Suite Settling into my seat I found an adjustable and dimmable reading light to my left including satisfying clunk sound when rotated adjacent to an enclosed panel housing a mirror and top loading literature pocket For unknown reasons there were no High Life or Business Life magazines loaded onboard although the top of the unit was endowed with a traditional amount of BA sponsored dust Additional reading lights are available overhead one angled over the table and one over the side ledge Disappointingly BA have chosen not to include personal air vents either in the overhead panel or within the seat The ample side ledge is home to two storage compartments the larger of which includes a touchscreen wired remote control for the IFE together with power and two USB sockets these sockets were not enabled whilst the aircraft was on the ground which was somewhat inconvenient The larger compartment features a gap between the lid and the base of the ledge allowing devices to be charged whilst still being used by the passenger with the lid of the compartment closed this is very smart Below these compartments a smart built in touchscreen panel allows convenient seat adjustments alongside three more traditional adjustment buttons I often find these sorts of screens are slow to turn themselves off between use but this screen was response and quick to dim minimising light pollution in dark cabins This is another benefit of having the wired remote control for the IFE located within a compartment rather than seat side Footrests in these seat types are traditionally fairly limited in size and the Club Suite is no exception to this without being amongst the worst of offenders Even bulkhead seats suffer the same fate as I would experience on the return sector and shown in the second image below Next to the footrest a secondary literature pocket houses the safety card with a further open storage compartment being the perfect place to store a bottle of water The aisle side armrest is lowerable to allow additional width when in bed mode and easy egress from the seat with the table deployed This armrest does not feature an internal storage compartment as it does on the same seat on Qatar Airways I popped the seat into fully flat bed mode there was ample space and plenty of privacy with easy access to the seat s in built storage compartments all in stark contrast to BA s existing Club World seat The large IFE screen offers touch controls although given its distance from the seat I found it more convenient to use the remote control In a neat feature on boarding the screens all stated Club Europe alongside the seat number I had expected this to say Club World given the aircraft s intended market but was impressed at this attention to detail Additionally the IFE was programmed with Spanish as its alternative language Madrid obviously being one of the destinations loaded into the system Many of the safety notices dotted around the cabin were also in Spanish reflecting BA s Madrid based parent company IAG The A350 fleet features the same system as that on fully refurbished aircraft the excellent Panasonic eX3 On the A350 this allows for one of my favourite setups the moving map to be displayed on the remote control screen with other content playing on the main screen Sadly BA opted not to install an exterior camera system to their A350s whilst clearly not an essential feature for passenger comfort I do enjoy having this feature enabled for takeoff and landing where fitted Wifi was enabled on this flight although with a measly MB of data chargeable at close to GBP18 I chose to gaze out of the A350 s expansive windows instead BA did not choose Airbus s slick option of electronic window blinds for their A350 fleet instead opting for traditional plastic manual pull down affairs Adjacent to the IFE screen within the seat shell a coat hook can be found whilst below the screen a decently sized table is stored This is deployed along a rather ungainly runner fixed to the side of the seat and can be doubled in size once fully deployed by folding over the second leaf Once the table is pushed back towards the screen into its second fixed position it can t be folded away unless it s pulled back towards the passenger this is somewhat annoying initially although in time will become a familiar routine Naturally the table was somewhat dirty despite this being amongst the first of the aircraft s passenger flights The Club Suite s standout feature at least on paper is the door This is unlocked by the crew after takeoff and is locked open again before landing although an announcement was made shortly after takeoff requesting doors remained open during the meal service to aid cabin crew service Sadly given the door s limited height matched to the surrounds of the seat and with a decent gap to the floor it offers limited additional privacy over the already perfectly adequate seat shell With the door closed the amount of space offered by each seat is less than that afforded by QR s Qsuite although not dramatically so Indeed in comparison to the same Super Diamond seat on QR BA s version feels much more private with a higher seat shell The door is somewhat flimsy and I fear that over time through passenger use and abuse many will become inoperable and require regular maintenance For instance on my return flight the door somehow locked itself in the open position with the cabin crew having to show me how to unlock it from the outside of the seat a setting normally reserved for crew use only Centre seats have a fairly substantial moveable divider between each pair At each seat there were of course limited amenities given the duration of this flight longhaul style unbranded headphones were provided in one of the side ledge storage compartments although I used my own pair of Bose headphones with a White Company pillow on the seat As we climbed through the clouds I took a moment to study the seat s materials in a little more detail The walnut effect trim to the side ledge dark vinyl to the ledge top and seat shell and the understated navy blue fabric to the seat itself are all visually appealing although the silver trim to the storage compartments looks a little cheap with visible signs of wear and tear on an aircraft barely two weeks into its British Airways career at the time of flying The flock effect covering of the inside of the seat shell and the suite door is really not to my personal taste although blends well with the overall design aesthetic of the seat Whether a build quality issue or by design the seat itself shook audibly during taxi and on occasion as cabin crew or passengers passed in the adjacent aisle this will be less than ideal during a night flight As we levelled off cabin service commenced with a hot towel and the offer of a menu Presumably due to the narrow aisles in the Club cabin on the A350 and trolleys not featuring as part of the Club World service dinner service on this flight was entirely hand run from the galley Although a pre dinner bar service is usually offered on Band and Band Club Europe sectors cabin crew can choose to skip this on busy flights instead offering drinks alongside the meal with today s flight virtually full in the forward Club cabin the bar service was skipped today The British roast chicken runner beans garden peas potato risotto and thyme jus was excellent accompanied by a quarter bottle of the Sauvignon Blanc Given the A350 s large table I could even excuse the lack of a bread plate for my bread roll which incidentally was pre selected and pre placed in a distinctly non premium manner on top of the dessert pot rather than being offered from the basket as is the norm in Club Europe After dinner I headed aft to the Doors galley where the Club Kitchen is situated on longhaul flights a selection of drinks and snacks is available here for Club World passengers to help themselves to The product offering in the Club Kitchen has taken a cut virtually year on year since its introduction so I was pleased to see a healthy sized space for a hopefully equally healthy sized selection The cabin crew on this flight were an unusual mix of Mixed Fleet and Worldwide crew I had a brief chat with a member of the A350 Integration Team who explained a few of the aircraft s features and noted that due to the small size of the Doors galley Door L would not normally be used for boarding or disembarkation Visiting Club Kitchen also offered a brief glimpse into the aft Club World cabin at just three rows enhanced privacy can be obtained here although I would be concerned about traffic to and from the washrooms potentially not getting my first choice of meal as well as noise from the World Traveller Plus cabin behind Talking of World Traveller Plus I popped into this cabin for a brief look taking advantage of the fact that on this flight the cabin was not being occupied by anyone beyond a handful of cabin crew in the front row one of whom didn t see me enter the cabin initially and came back to ask what I was doing presuming I was an interloper from the World Traveller cabin The of legroom felt more than adequate thanks to the slim design of the seats Each seat offers a manual foot rest coat hook and a handy water bottle holder situated between each pair of seats An open storage compartment is available below the decently sized IFE touchscreen above a literature pocket upholstered in the same smart fabric as the seat A shared drinks console is available at the end of the centre armrest with an IFE remote control and two manual seat adjustment buttons one for recline and one for the leg rest located directly below Power and USB sockets are available at the base of the centre console Overall the World Traveller Plus cabin felt airy and spacious although with every seat occupied I m not sure it would feel the same way Whilst WTP passengers have to venture aft to one of the six World Traveller washrooms Club World passengers have three dedicated for their use one in the forward galley on the port side and two in the centre of the Doors galley None of them are endowed with windows but all have the usual White Company hand wash and hand balm Parking at T4S airbridges were brought to both Doors L and L although with L opening first this is where I exited my first BA A350 flight The cabin crew held back rear cabins allowing the forward cabin to disembark first Despite the usual lengthy transit train ride to the main T4 building there was no queue at immigration and with hand baggage only I was soon kerbside in the arrivals area fighting my way through a mass of people searching for their hotel shuttle bus Crowne Plaza Madrid Airport Madrid Airport is rather odd in that despite being a major international hub airport it lacks any proper hotel connected to or within the immediate vicinity of its main terminal T4 To this end faced with a mandatory hotel shuttle bus experience I chose the closest half decent IHG offering for my brief overnight stay between flights the Crowne Plaza Hotel shuttle buses are usually a rather stressful experience and the Crowne Plaza s was no exception this evening Scheduled to run every minutes during core hours my wait amongst the crowds of the arrivals area was pushing the top end of this limit Once I d secured my space on board the clean but cosy bus it took around minutes to reach the property at the side of a main road in an unattractive industrial area on the airport s boundary The CP s lobby is unassuming at best Busy with guests checking in and with no priority desk for IHG Elite members despite this being a published benefit at all IHG properties it took around ten minutes for formalities to be completed including reserving a spot on one of the morning shuttle buses to get me back to the airport in good time My Suite on the second floor was large and represented a several category upgrade from my booked Deluxe standard room Entering the suite a walk in closet to the left housed two dining chairs of all things with the bathroom off to the right Ahead the spacious rectangular bedroom featured a king size bed two deep armchairs and occasional table together with a desk minibar adjacent to additional luggage storage Amusingly the bedroom also included two further dining chairs oddly placed adjacent to the bedside tables There was no view to speak of from the window from what I could tell it was mainly of another side of the hotel The white painted walls together with the bright wall lights ceiling spotlights angled onto the wall and vinyl faux wood floor throughout with no hint at a rug near the bed lent a stark and clinical atmosphere to the bedroom and was not even remotely luxurious The overall design was rather cobbled together a mix of more recent elements such as the modern artwork lighting flooring and armchairs combined with dated wooden furniture pieces Perhaps the most surprising design feature was the shower cubicle protruding like some sort of sleazy spaceship into the bedroom I was just thankful that I was travelling alone on this occasion The bathroom itself was decently sized with a large jacuzzi bathtub dual sinks and separate room housing toilet and bidet Amenities were by Hierbas de Mallorca an unknown brand to me and one that didn t make it into my suitcase at the end of the stay Whilst there was plenty of bath and shower gel body milk and hair conditioner in an obvious oversight there was no shampoo it took me a few attempts to get through to housekeeping on the phone although the shampoo arrived promptly in the end There were a few thoughtful inclusions in the room pillow spray and chocolates by the bed slippers and bathrobes in the bathroom albeit placed in the bathtub complimentary water on the minibar tray and a Nespresso coffee machine Other elements confused me a charger for a non existent phone on the bedside table only unbranded black tea on the minibar tray and no room service menu Check out the following morning was a much more efficient affair with no queue and with the shuttle bus all to myself I left the hotel with a more favourable view than at my arrival In booking this hotel I had considered staying at the InterContinental in the city centre a property I ve experienced and enjoyed a couple of times before Whilst staying at the IC would undoubtedly have resulted in a more comfortable stay and whilst the trip from the airport might have been a little quicker in an on demand taxi despite the longer distance from the airport this would have been at three times the cost of my CP stay The Crowne Plaza might not be perfect but it represents a functional and good value choice for an inter trip stay MAD LHR With mobile boarding pass in hand and no luggage to check in I headed straight for Fast Track security on arrival at Terminal I ve always had good experiences with security here and this morning was no exception with the dedicated area processing passengers quickly with virtually no queue I ve reviewed Iberia s spacious light filled Premium Lounge Vel√°zquez in T4S on several occasions previously most recently in its refurbished state in here After a bite of breakfast I headed along to Gate S29 where G XWBA was waiting for me once again Almost all gates at T4S are equipped with at least two airbridges allowing for easy separation at the gate of priority boarding eligible passengers despite only one airbridge to Door L being used for boarding today Once all passengers were settled in their seats with me this time in A there was a short wait before pushback as hold luggage had to be rebalanced to ensure even weight distribution I assume Madrid s ground handlers were not very familiar with the A350 at this point and was glad that the issue had been identified before departure During the ground delay the cabin crew including some familiar faces from the previous day s flight took the opportunity of distributing menus to Club Europe passengers although hot towels weren t provided until after takeoff As with the outbound flight the crew chose to skip the bar service before lunch and completed the meal service entirely from the galley with no use of trolleys Service was a little more haphazard than the previous flight with the majority of the cabin crew seemingly flying on the A350 for only their first or second time For instance my meal tray was served initially without the main course as it was still being heated in the galley and the bread was handed to me in a serviette by an apologising cabin crew member rather than it being offered from a basket The tray that I did receive was a top up tray loaded at Heathrow for use on this inbound flight but featuring the outbound starter cheese and dessert Top up trays are loaded when there are additional last minute passengers booked to travel although the crew clearly did not work through the trays to ensure it was these passengers who received the non menu matching trays Despite this I was actually pleased to receive the outbound options again as the cherry tomato and mozzarella salad starter listed on the menu would not have been to my taste My main course of baked risotto saut√©ed asparagus and mushrooms in panna sauce was well worth the wait I d had this option previously on a flight home from Warsaw the previous month although on that occasion it had been rather overcooked This time it was perfectly baked allowing the true flavours to make themselves known As we approached Runway R at Heathrow in rather windy conditions the aircraft performed what was my first and presumably its first in service go around it was quite a powerful climb out of our approach due to what the captain announced was a wind shear warning Our second approach despite being fairly bumpy ended in a safe landing although for the A350 things were less plain sailing with a trip being required to the maintenance base for checks it was rumoured that these checks were a result of the go around having been performed at high speed with flaps extended These checks meant that evening s and following morning s A350 rotations to Madrid were cancelled replaced with a far less interesting Parking at T5C and exiting from Door L with the cabin crew sadly not holding back rear cabins I reflected on what had been two highly enjoyable flights Whilst some of the materials BA have chosen to use in the Club Suite do not appear to be entirely durable and the suite door is something of a gimmick the product is so far removed from the seat it replaces that these issues pale into relative insignificance At the time of writing this report in April the Club Suite was being fitted to all new longhaul aircraft deliveries with refurbishments in progress on the majority of the fleet through to the end of The Club Suite will not be fitted to the fleet due for retirement by the small midhaul configured A321 fleet or the lone A318 plying the LCY JFK route although it is expected to be fitted to the existing and A380 fleets although the latter type may not be long for this world given its operating cost The Club Suite represents an exciting new product for British Airways which coupled with the new Club World service as I experienced in here places BA firmly back in the game of longhaul business class products

449,449,As Britain s health food store retailers find themselves on the frontline of a national effort to keep the country nourished healthy and protected during the coronavirus crisis Jim Manson reports on Operation Healthy Lockdown At pm on Monday March the Prime Minister announced that Britain was going into lockdown All non essential retail businesses would close from midnight In the small hours of Tuesday morning came confirmation that health food stores would stay open It s been business not as usual ever since At the time of writing Britain s lockdown has just been extended for a further three weeks it seems likely that restrictions could continue well into summer Parts of the population may be asked to self isolate for as long as a year The ramifications for health physical emotional societal are enormous Amid all this natural products retailers find themselves on the frontline of a nationwide effort to keep the country nourished healthy and protected Welcome to the new normal The new normal arrived abruptly for health stores The sense of being in uncharted territory felt very real for Josine Atsma owner of Stirling Health Food Store We really didn t have anything to compare this to We re still learning as we go So how has business been holding up since the lockdown began and what is Stirling Health Food Store doing differently Business overall is up We had a ridiculously busy period in the week before the lockdown better than Christmas we were up something like on usual store sales A third of the shop was empty by the end of the week Since then we ve been about up although actual footfall is down Taking stock The biggest change says Atsma is how people are shopping We used to get one click and collect order every four or five days Now we re getting between five and seven each day Atsma says she is now focusing on the essentials the food products that people really need to have To do this she s freed up shelf space normally occupied by home brew products It s made way for flour and other important things like gluten free products I think we have a bit of responsibility as retailers to make the essentials available That s the way I feel and that s the way I m running the business Going the extra mile Avril McCracken administrator at the National Association of Health Stores NAHS says the current crisis has shown the trade at its very best So many retailers have really been going the extra mile for their customers and communities The NAHS estimates that health stores have been about down on sales since the lockdown but that pre lockdown panic buying will mean that year to date sales should be holding up overall One member told us they d had people in their store on a single day at the peak of the frenzy says McCracken She adds that certain product categories are still in high demand Vitamin C vitamin D beta glucan are all selling well Grocery staples canned products and dried goods like porridge are also selling strongly Aloe vera gel is flying off shelves as people try to find solutions to dry skin Natural sanitizers too and hair dye We re seeing a progression of needs Mark McCarty co director of distributor World Foods Brand Management says business is booming A key driver of current high sales levels is the large number of new consumers coming to the market An opportunity to make new customers Quite a lot of those new customers will be heading to Boots or Amazon McCarty wants to see them become health store regulars I think health food stores have an opportunity to create a completely new interest in their businesses They can become storage hubs for products that you simply can t get elsewhere A lot of stores are operating on a am pm basis using the rest of the day to pack mail orders The shift in the trade towards click and collect and home delivery has been extraordinary says McCarty Just take our business with Holland they want wholefoods explains Spencer The four phases of wellness buying in the corona crisis Research by US wellness specialist SPINS identifies four distinct phases of consumer behaviour in the corona crisis Proactive Self Care Pantry Prep Quarantine and New Normal the still unknown future that we will enter after the main lockdown is lifted The proactive self care period was characterized by a huge uplift in sales of vitamins and supplements digestive enzymes and herbal products The prep and loading phase saw continued strong sales of VMS but also a surge in demand for grocery staples and household products In the quarantine itself proactive

3075,3075,"Why can't trump be more specific and point out the actual instances where the press reports inaccurate stories? Oh that's right, because he can't. Donald Trump is a snowflake, and criticism drives him mad. So like any child, he lashes out and attacks people personally but can't actually argue facts and truths, because he has no argument. For example, If Trump were to actually tweet out ""Jim Acosta said it rained today but that is a lie it was sunny all day in DC,"" he would have much more credibility. But because the media, though biased, is reporting truths, Trump has no counter. So instead, Trump insults them with blanket, general statements like ""fake news"" and ""enemy of the people."" Or he has them banned from press briefings."

There you have it, my recommendation that you stand up for the american chinese community and participate in the representation process of the West means I'm advocating you become an Uncle Chan. As if that's not racist as f***. & it's Chinese operatives like FenrisWolf perpetuating these racist slurs against you. Guess what, the majority of the Chinese diaspora do not visit Gamefaqs, and you are not Chinese and know nothing about the complexities of the Chinese community, so take your Yellow Peril nonsense elsewhere. I'm afraid it's you who is making the racist slurs by claiming that anyone who disagrees with you ""Chinese operatives"". And in Australia, a Taiwanese woman with the same anti-PRC paranoia ran as a candidate for the xenophobic, anti-immigration One Nation party, saying that all ""good Chinese would vote for her"", even though the same party previous claimed that Australia is ""being swamped with Asians"" before. Turns out later she also advocated for gays to be sent to mental institutions she she was dumped.

5555,5555,Open Letter to the Sandernistas Bernie Caves Again wrote this article almost four years ago right after the Democratic primaries in I am reposting it because it demonstrates how while history changes the machinations of the Democratic Party are the same or in this case worse What is not relevant in this article is that there are no gender identity politics as there were with Hillary What is new about Bernie dropping out today is that Bernie has conceded four months before the Democratic convention Capitalism has gotten worse in the U S because of a combination of the trade wars with China more bad debt pile ups and now the coronavirus In spite of these worsening conditions the Democratic Party has chosen a far weaker candidate than Hillary to run Joe Biden These conditions must make it even more exasperating for the Sandernistas when Bernie does not step up to the plate and disappoints his followers by again caving into the DNC Read below what I wrote in June Even More Power to ya Sandernistas As someone who has been a radical socialist for years I can t tell you how happy I am to see so many people under in my college classes and on the streets who declare themselves socialists Secondly I respect how critical your presence has been during this political campaign by showing up at Trump rallies despite being in the vast minority arguing screaming and in some cases fighting with his supporters Thirdly I respect you for fighting at the Democratic primaries in Nevada causing a ruckus I am delighted you saw through the mass media s attempt to keep you away from the polls on the day of the California primary and came out to vote anyway I admire your willingness to stand in lines and vote and deal with both real official incompetence and planned irregularities in vote counting voting machines that don t work as well as many obstacles put in your path About a month ago I read a political report from the United Nations comparing democratic processes across nations It stated that the US voting process was ranked in the world in democratic processes Not so hot for a declining empire that fancies itself the home of democracy By world democratic standards future elections in the US should be monitored by representatives of countries that have proven themselves to be ranked in the top ten Lastly I am so proud of you for co creating a political revolution I have rarely voted in my life because electoral politics is part of a capitalist machine The two or three times I have voted I ve been embarrassed about it During most election cycles I cannot wait for them to end because the air waves are filled with professional windbags embalmed hair dyed Botox injected toupee wearing mummies and stuffed pheasants jingling with the trappings of Divine Honors But these last six months have been more exciting for me because of all the rotten centrist candidates the nobles the barons the dukes the earls and the duchesses have had their royal ball ruined by you and by the Trumpsters You may not like the Trumpsters and you might not like their motives but because of their rallies they have driven even worse plutocrats to the margins Jeb Bush fancying himself as being installed as Bush III to the presidency must have been quite insulted when the Trumpsters blew him Ted Cruz and the rest of the Republican lizards to the political periphery But now you are at a crossroads After six months of a political revolution the Democratic power elite has heaved its harried painted disheveled roughed up Queen in a buckboard to the top of a small mountain with its media mafioso lobbyists police and military escorts declaring herself to be Queen Now comes the heavy duty propaganda Here Comes Hyper Identity Politics Identity politics softball The Democratic plutocrats are not worried about winning over the upper middle class women who will take any woman who had been crowned and claim her as a feminist My partner was invited to appear on a panel today on a supposedly radical radio station titled Feminism is Not a Dirty Word On this station they had a rabid supporter of Hillary Clinton and I thought we would share the words from her website This is only the beginning of what you re going to be listening to for the next months I guess you could call me a sentimental sap My eyes welled as I sat riveted by the television image of Hillary Clinton claiming the Democratic presidential nomination on Tuesday night as the primary contests results rolled in the first woman to win the presidential nomination of a major party in the United States of America OK so maybe even a sob happened Call me a sentimental sap but forgive my tears A woman has just won the presidential nomination of one of our two major political parties An accomplished woman A woman who can throw a rhetorical punch A woman who s made tough choices And for the sake of all of the women who come after her that s a righteously good thing We ve been waiting a long time By Adele M Stan The American Prospect This is a warmed over version of what was trotted out as a victory for African Americans in when Obama was elected Obama went on to be the most intelligent sounding Republican in many year a surveillance crazed drone flying protectionist war mongering monster But he did it with more grace charm and optimism than any of the usual bible thumping conservatives And after all he is good at basketball Let s face our nightmares Hillary on stage being crowned and kissed by the first African American president and the First African American Lady Michelle Obama Together they stand waving to adoring crowds We get to watch racial identity politics standing together with gender identity politics The fact that both have been selected by the one percent in the Council of Foreign Relations doesn t matter Class dismissed The audience goes wild tears in their eyes Diversity wins again We don t need the Trumpsters to tell us Make America Great Again We have it right here in our beloved Democratic Party Except the gender and identify political elites do it in a civilized way They don t threaten to build walls and kick ass What Does Bernie Do But the worst is yet to come Bernie Sanders your hero is trotted onto the stage Obama Michelle and even Hillary embrace him politely All praise his fire his bringing important issues to the table They thank him for attracting so many young people like y all to the Democratic Party Then it is Bernie s turn What will he say He will thank everyone and especially you You fought the good fight But now it is time to fold up your little tents and join the bigger tent of Hillary and fight against the evil Trump Some of you will buy this propaganda and believe that the Democratic Party can find its soul and be reborn with a born again Bernie along with all your youthful energy Many of you will be intimated by hardball identity politics which I ll discuss shortly and give in If you think this might be the case for you you can stop reading Identity politics hardball This is also a delicate political moment since most of you are white you are in the audiences everywhere and on the stage will be the kings and queens of identity politics rich trim well spoken and in control of the microphone with the mass media at its beck and call As white male Sandernistas you will be hammered with insinuations that you are a sexist for not voting for Hillary and a racist for not listening to the wise African American heads of state who are much older and smarter than you White Sandernista women will be told they have betrayed feminism by not supporting Hillary Black men for Bernie will be chastised for not listening to Obama and other black leaders who have made their nests in the middle rungs of the Democratic Party For black women it will be insinuated that you don t know enough not to have the nerve to hesitate or even turn your back and walk away when such a well spoken fit African American lady like Michelle invites you into the Democratic tent For those of you who are Mexican immigrants you will be ordered to get into Hillary s tent quickly because she is the only one standing between you Trump the howling Trumpsters and the wall Dire Straits for Radical SandernistasFor those of you who will not come into Hillary s tent you will be in great pain Bernie is telling you you have lost fair and square and you should shake hands and be friends with the illustrious Democratic notables especially Barbara Boxer who graciously gave you the finger in Nevada And since you are so good at waiting in line at polling booths if you get into a neat line and be quiet the great feminist leader Gloria Steinem might sign autographs for you Many of you will feel angry and betrayed and not know where to turn You are at a crossroads The Red and Black Flag is Still FlyingSince the heyday of the s before most of you were born the real socialist left in the United States has been torn apart by factions Social Democrats various types of Marxist Leninists council communists and anarchists have fought bitterly against each other before during and after revolutions in some cases for over years over the kind of socialism we wanted to bring to the world All these groups have also been infiltrated and almost destroyed by the Secret Service Since the s many of us hung on isolated dispirited and in some cases broken Some got religion some became New Age junkies some were reduced to paranoid conspiracy addicts and others simply gave up Many of us however have never given up We have hung on as writers artists and theatre producers Others joined unions and stayed in them continuing to believe that the unions were still the best breeding grounds for socialism Some like me have worked as college teachers smuggling in socialist ideas under the radar of official course syllabi and sometimes in private conversations or even open discussions Almost five years ago the anarchist inspired Occupy movement gave hope to many of us At its high point in the Occupy movement blockaded downtown public space in cities and shut down some of the busiest ports on the West Coast This combined with the economic crash of made things suddenly uncomfortable for the increasingly maniacally speculating and very nervous capitalist class Many of us were amazed to discover thanks to the catalyst of Bernie Sanders that more than half of the people your age have declared themselves interested in socialism But Bernie has taken you as far as he wants to go You can either find your way yourselves or you can join us Many of us have been around long enough politically to understand how the Democratic Party works and have anticipated how they want to use you and trick you into following them At the Democratic National Convention the Democratic Party will show its true capitalist colors We have other hopes and plans for you We also know that you represent the possibility of a real socialist movement which can only happen outside the Democratic Party As socialists we haven t seen this opportunity in the United States in years We are going to insist you deal with us In June and July of this year there will be socialist conferences There is one happening at the same time as the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia The day will be a traumatic ride for you demonstrating in the streets fighting on the floor of the Democratic Convention and then losing Yet alongside this bitter disappointment we long term socialists are hoping to win you over We are not easy to get along with Many of us are angry just from the wear and tear of putting up with a declining capitalist system for years Others do not have good social skills In fact I can say I ve never met so many unsociable socialists as exist in this country Yet some of us have a great deal of organizational skills We think strategically and tactically We are largely self educated sometimes fanatical but we have a great deal of heart though many are too crabby to show it We have a great deal of persistence and don t give up easily Like you many of us will come to this convention paying for it with money out of our own pockets because we have hope that together we can form a national political movement

1426,1426,"Originally posted by Kwibus: I support snowballing AI! Currently doing an Vortex campaign as Teclis. I conquered Lustria by turn 140, except for Khalida, she was my ally, but I cancelled it as she decided to declare war on my real friends in Ulthuan so I expect to destroy her soon as well. The problem of this campaign is M 's strength rank 1 and the bar is 80% red on the most favourable turns. Currently he's conquering Ulthuan and since on Ulthuan I got my friends and allies I can see all the stacks of D ?? It's always Naggarond that's able to seemingly have a lot more armies than other factions so if he snowballs he's imo by far the scariest to deal with. Since I've conquered Lustria I'm sending my 2 strongest armies to Ulthuan and I confederated Allariel to try and get a foothold there and recruit 2 strong stacks in hopes of stopping the purple tide, but actually I'm not sure if I can since there are so many DE armies full of dragons and ! Khemri is 3rd in strength and decided to be friends with N , but I managed to beat them down pretty quickly, but they never had close to the number of armies the DE have. Sure the Skaven end game armies are painful and specially sieging their tier V cities are rough, but I never ran into problems. , lightning strike is broken.

9039,9039,"I‚Äôm just going to lay this out before going into this post. I‚Äôm IN NO WAY a beauty expert. I do a lot of research on products before I buy them, whether it be YouTube reviews or written reviews. Everyone‚Äôs hair and skin are different, but these products I honestly feel anyone would enjoy. Also, this is a long post. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è My skin products: I can‚Äôt say that I follow a routine perfectly, but I‚Äôve found that taking off your makeup entirely each day is very important. A lot of times wiping your makeup off with a makeup remover wipe alone can be kind of hard. THE SOLUTION COMBO? Micellar water + wipes. Try to moisturize as much as possible. The Mario Badescu facial spray keeps your skin very hydrated, smells awesome, and makes you feel like a new woman. Also, this elf moisturizer is super cheap and works really well. As for face masks, don‚Äôt be extra about it. Maybe do one like once every week or even every two weeks. (Be cautious with them depending on your skin type). My last skin care product comment.. USE CHAPSTICK. My hair products: I‚Äôve been trying to grow it out lately, so I take hair skin and nails gummies, and I use Not your mothers way to grow shampoo & conditioner. I truly believe these two things work for hair growth. ALWAYS USE HEAT PROTECTANT. That‚Äôs all. This is going to sound super skanky, but wash your hair as least as possible. Don‚Äôt walk around lookin like a skillet, but your natural oils in your hair keep it moisturized. I don‚Äôt use dry shampoo often, but when I do I use Batiste. Also, I use leave in treatments and this Nexxus oil for strength and shine. Leave in conditioner is also a solution for dry hair. This isn‚Äôt pictured, but I‚Äôd also recommend a wet brush (with boar bristles). Lastly, I use scrunchies. I know you‚Äôre probably judging, but the type of hair tie you‚Äôre using can make or break you. Tight hair ties can make dead ends occur. Switch up the placement of your hair tie too."

6599,6599,Los Angeles Washington Apr efe epa Several California beaches seemed to be overflowing on Sunday after local authorities lifted some of the quarantine restrictions although recommendations that people remain in home confinement are still in force in the state and elsewhere in the US where the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread and the number of confirmed cases is approaching million The beaches in Orange County in Southern California were filled with thousands of bathers who flocked to the sand and surf starting on Friday during the current heat wave after local officials lifted various restrictions The beaches looked like they have on any summer weekend in past years According to the media more than people turned out on Saturday at certain beaches including the one at Newport and the crowd could be bigger on Sunday At the beginning of this past week the Orange County commissioners voted to keep some beaches and open air areas open although local parking lots will remain closed for the time being In contrast beaches in Los Angeles County including the famous Santa Monica and Venice beaches remain vacant at the insistence of local authorities who are not relaxing the quarantine measures yet and are keeping them closed to the public Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti warned in a message on Instagram and other social networks on Sunday We won t let one weekend undo a month of progress While the sun is tempting we re staying home to save lives The places we love our beaches hiking trails will still be there when this is over And by staying home we re making sure our loved ones will be too the mayor added The US has been the country hardest hit by the coronavirus in absolute terms with confirmed cases and deaths according to the ongoing tally being kept by The Johns Hopkins University In light of how the pandemic is evolving Dr Deborah Birx the coordinator of the White House working group on Covid said Sunday in an interview with the NBC television network that social distancing measures will be continued all summer despite the gradual reopening of the economy Although Birx said that information coming out of Louisiana and Detroit where Covid cases have possibly peaked gives us great hope for hard hit areas like New York City she added that social distancing will be with us through the summer to really ensure that we protect one another She said that she and other officials will continue monitoring the pandemic closely In recent days several states have begun moving to lift social distancing measures and reactivate their economies and it is expected that more than a dozen will lift such measures at least partially this coming week including Alaska Georgia Oklahoma South Carolina and Tennessee which have already begun opening some businesses such as hair salons gymnasiums and bowling alleys In response to a question about whether she was afraid of losing what has been gained over the past six weeks of quarantine by reopening some states Birx said that she had been holding talks with governors adding that they understand the risks and are talking about gradually resuming more normal activities in their states rather than simply ending all measures at once Also commenting about resuming economic activities on Sunday was Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who outlined the calendar for the recovery I think as we begin to reopen the economy in May and June you re going to see the economy really bounce back in July August September Mnuchin told Fox News We are putting an unprecedented amount of fiscal relief into the economy You re seeing trillions of dollars that s making its way into the economy and I think this is going to have a significant impact he added US lawmakers have approved four economic rescue packages valued at almost trillion although the Congressional Budget Office projected on Friday that the country s fiscal deficit will triple to trillion and unemployment will reach percent due to the Covid crisis Mnuchin did not rule out future stimulus packages to assist states and cities saying that if the government needs to spend the money then it will but only with bipartisan congressional support Some governors such as New York s Andrew Cuomo who heads the state that has been the epicenter for the pandemic in the US have criticized the federal government for not providing additional aid to state and local governments but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell a Republican opposes rescue packages for the states and has suggested that they can simply declare bankruptcy

There are 2 types of foraging trips these birds will make; 1 where they‚Äôll leave at dawn and return in the evening, travelling up to 25km away from their colony - and a second trip where they will only be 7km away from the rookery. üá¶üá∂ Yellow Eyed penguins will only nest when they‚Äôre out of sight from other penguins. In August, a nesting site is chosen by the birds then 2 eggs are laid in September and incubated for 39 - 51 days. 6 weeks after hatching, the chicks are protected by one parent at a time whilst the other goes to feed at sea; eventually both parents will go to sea and the chicks will be completely independent by mid-February. Then by the age of 3/4 years they‚Äôll start breeding and form life-long relationships. üá¶üá∂ The conservation of this species is endangered with an estimated 4,000 left in the wild and their main threat is said to be invasive predators and the ruining of their habitats by other animals. ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢"

9046,9046,Hannah leaned backwards in the chair having put her feet up on the table with her hands in the back of her head The first time she had been brought in for questioning she may have felt a bit scared and anxious but this must ve been the twelfth time by now Every time her terrorist mother farted outside of the city walls the UCE guards would bring her and her father in for questioning For some reason they left Horst alone but because he was with them they must ve figured they d be able to keep tabs on him that way Two younger guards came in the interrogation room two Hannah had never seen before The flag on their shoulder was French and the letters above it spelling out the name of their country confirmed it They were probably new transfers from one of the French cities doing their tour around Europe They just had the bad luck of being in Aachen at this point in time The female of the two immediately got physical knocking back Hannah s feet from the table Hey easy now Hannah said in English knowing these two Frenchies probably did not speak a word of German If I have to be here every time my mother takes a piss out there I might as well get comfortable right Yu du that at yur ouse tuu the female guard asked with a thick French accent Well yeah Hannah answered Kind of speaks for itself no Je ne comprends pas pourquoi ils ne jettent pas son cul en prison tant que sa m re est l bas I do not understand why they just do not throw her ass in jail as long as her mother is out there the male spoke Et son p re et son fr re aussi Sa m re est une putain de terroriste et cette petite garce est un trafiquant de drogue And her father and her brother too Her mother s a goddamn terrorist and this little bitch here is a drugdealer Hannah looked at the two and made a stupid face at them Omelet du fromage Cr pe suzette et de caf au lait hon hon hon Hannah then said having picked that up from cartoons back in the day Salope stupide Stupid bitch the female guard said Va te faire foutre Go fuck yourself Well du pain du vin du Boursin and La Vache Qui Rit right back at ya Hannah said while smiling She then looked at the two way mirror where she knew someone she knew who was watching Serieus kolonel Van De Sande Seriously colonel Van De Sande Hannah spoke in Dutch Gebruik u me nu om uw groentjes te testen Are you using me now to test your rookies The two French guards who did not know what Hannah was saying looked at her Hannah just smiled back at them Oui je parle n erlandais Yes I speak Dutch Hannah said in French Et videmment je parle fran ais aussi Je suis plut t bon avec les langues que vous voyez And obviously I speak French too I am kind of good with languages you see Hannah laughed at the two guards as the door opened and colonel Van De Sande appeared He was a Belgian colonel from the part in Belgium that spoke Dutch Flanders and considering Aachen s proximity to the place and having had Flemish friends in the past Hannah had picked up on the language As far as French went she had taken it in school and had also picked it up very quickly Hannah was good in languages which compensated for her lack of knowledge when it came to sciences such as math physics and chemistry Languages just came natural to her The two guards then left with their tails between their legs as the colonel gestured them to get out Hetzelfde als altijd kolonel Same as always colonel Hannah said Ik heb mijn moeder niet gezien of gehoord Totaal geen contact en ik ben de stad niet uitgeweest I have not seen nor heard from my mother No contact at all and I have not left the city Colonel Van De Sande sat down in front of Hannah and sighed It was obvious the man had bigger worries than bringing in Hannah for questioning every time her mother made a move Sorry Hannah Van De Sande spoke Ik was te laat om ze tegen te houden Nieuwe mensen die zich aan de procedures willen houden Je weet hoe het gaat I was too late to stop them New people who want to keep themselves to procedures You know how it is Hannah did not like the UCE authorities at all but Van De Sande was alright He had a humane mindset unlike some of these other drones who clinged to the procedures like the bible It was also why Hannah had offered her help to the colonel and the only price he paid for it was keeping Hannah and the others names out of the draft so they would not be called in for military duty Hoe gaat het met Tamara How s Tamara doing Hannah asked inquiring after the colonel s daughter who was an epileptic Best wel ok Kind of fine Van De Sande answered De aanvallen zijn minder maar nog wel hevig The attacks are less but still heavy Ik zal kijken om u een nieuwe batch te brengen Een sterkere dosis deze keer I will see about getting you a new batch A stronger dose this time Dank je Hannah dat betekent veel voor mij Thanks Hannah it means a lot to me Ever since finding out Van De Sande s daughter had epilepsy Hannah had offered him to brew CBD oil for her knowing it greatly helped with epilepsy At this point they were just trying to figure out the right dose that would keep them away completely Hannah made a mental note to get a stronger batch to Van De Sande s house later on It was good to have friends in high places Hannah took her leave then from the interrogation room and passed the two French guards in the hallway Bienvenue Aix la Chapelle Welcome to Aachen Hannah said while she passed them N oubliez pas de visiter le tombeau de Charlemagne et si vous voulez ce go t de la maison avec des baguettes fra ches visitez le quartier fran ais Do not forget to visit Charlemagne s tomb and if you want that taste of home with fresh baguettes visit the French quarter Hannah then hop scotched out of the hallway being silly and heard the two guards cuss her out in French swear words she too was familiar with No hair of her back though As she came into the atrium she saw her dad and went over to him He too was annoyed about always being brought in whenever her mother made a move outside the walls Immer das gleiche ich werde es so leid Always the same I am getting so tired of it Magnus spoke Geht es dir gut Schatz Are you okay sweetheart Ja Van De Sande hat mich gerettet Er sagte er k nne sie diesmal nicht aufhalten Anscheinend neue Wachen Yeah Van De Sande bailed me out He said he could not stop them this time New guards apparently Hannah answered Ich schw re Papa eines Tages werde ich Mutter selbst beenden I swear dad one day I am going to end mother myself Hannah bitte sag das nicht Sie ist immer noch deine Mutter Hannah please do not say that She s still your mother Sie hat uns verlassen um mit ein paar Kriminellen zusammen zu sein Und in der Zwischenzeit ruiniert sie unser Leben wie sie es immer getan hat She left us to be with a bunch of criminals And in the meantime is ruining our lifes like she always has Her dad went silent Hannah just sighed Her mother had always been the love of his life and it hurt her to see him hurt like that But her father had trouble moving on and that she regretted greatly Schau Papa ich muss mich mit den Jungs treffen Look dad I have to meet with the guys Hannah said Ich sagte dem Oberst ich w rde ihm eine st rkere Menge l f r seine Tochter bringen Ich werde bis zur Ausgangssperre zu Hause sein ok I told the colonel I would bring him a stronger batch of oil for his daughter I will be home by curfew ok Okay sei einfach vorsichtig Okay just be careful Magnus answered Keine Probleme bekommen keiner vor euch Do not get in trouble any of you Magnus then kissed Hannah on the forehead and as he went home Hannah went to the gang s hangout in the lower district She met Dani l in the hallway and then went downstairs with him where she was greeted by anyone Fucking hell Ich wurde heute Morgen wieder von meinem Bett gehoben Fucking hell I was lifted again from my bed this morning Hannah said Ich bin es so leid jedes Mal zum Verh r gebracht zu werden wenn Mutter ihre Schei e an die W nde schmiert I am so tired of being brought in for interrogation every time mother smears her shit on the walls Hannah let herself drop down in the couch and put her feet on the coffeetable Adele asked if they were going to do anything today but Hannah felt like it was ruined already though Ich sagte Oberst Van De Sande wir w rden ihm eine st rkere Dosis CBD l f r seine Tochter bringen I told colonel Van De Sande we d bring him a stronger dose of CBD oil for his daughter Hannah said Wir sollten uns das also vor der Ausgangssperre ansehen Was den Rest betrifft ist mein Tag schon gefickt also rate ich Weed und Bier So we should look into that before curfew As for the rest my day is fucked already so I am guessing weed and beer

10859,10859,Vax has been delivering cordless vacuum cleaners for some time but this year the company s focus has been to move its products over to its ONEPWR battery system creating a suite of tools that all use the same replaceable battery Here we have Vax s entry level cordless stick cleaner the ONEPWR Blade Visibly similar to the Vax ONEPWR Blade this model lacks a brushless motor and ships with a smaller Ah battery but you can buy additional batteries if you want to boost its run time Vax ONEPWR Blade What you need to know General vacuuming Easy to use and empty this is a simple vacuum cleaner but its big brother slightly outclasses it Carpet test Picks up most mess but edge performance suffers Hard floor test Swept through the spilt rice but left some grains in the grouting Pet hair pick up Turbo mode makes short work of pet hair entwined in carpet fibres Related Best cordless vacuum cleaner Vax ONEPWR Blade design Neat and easy to use but it doesn t stand up by itself The Vax ONEPWR Blade adheres to the same cordless vacuum cleaner design blueprint that Vax has followed for some time This model is notable for the l bin which sits horizontally across the front of the vacuum cleaner Unclip it from the front and the bin lifts out so you can open the flap beneath and empty the contents directly into the bin At the other end of the bin you ll find a secondary flap that covers the washable filter Once the filter is out the entire internal assembly can be pulled apart this makes it easy to wash the unit or empty any dust that has become stubbornly stuck to the inside of the bin The bin pulls apart to make it easy to empty and clean This vacuum cleaner has a similar set of controls to the other models in the range with a power button to turn the cleaner on and off This helps to avoid the fatigue associated with having to hold in a trigger making this vacuum cleaner more suitable for people who struggle to hold their grip There s also a button that turns on the boost function to provide greater suction power when required Finally there s a button to engage the motorised roller on the floor brush whose bristles are designed to agitate dust On hard floors it may be helpful to turn this latter function off and rely on suction power alone The controls are simple and easy to use With the motorised brush clipped into the wand the Vax ONEPWR Blade operates as a regular vacuum cleaner It s a fairly nimble unit letting you get low to the floor However a little more movement on the joint would make it easier to move around chair legs and the like twist a bit too hard and you ll end up removing the head s contact with the floor The vacuum cleaner is nimble enough to get around most furniture Neatly the motorised brush head has an LED on the front helping you spot any dust that you might otherwise miss Just note that the LED only lights up if the motorised brush is turned on Weighing just kg the Vax ONEPWR Blade is light enough to use where you need it This includes lifting it high to clean around ceilings and the tops of cupboards You won t find much by way of accompaniments to the vacuum cleaner In the box are a basic crevice tool and dusting brush An accessory clip attaches to the vacuum s wand enabling you to carry around your most used accessory but there s no other storage provided The accessory clip is useful but some more on board tool storage would have been welcome If you buy from Vax you get a Cordless ProKit included This nets you an upholstery brush with a stiff brush attachment an extending flexible crevice tool that s perfect for getting down the back of radiators and an extendible tube which lets you get into hard to reach areas A drawstring bag for storage is also included and is a great reason to buy direct This kit would normally set you back The accessory kit expands the range of tasks the cleaner can handle A smaller motorised tool for dealing with stairs would have been welcome particularly if you have carpet I found the standard brush or crevice tool fine for dealing with my hard floor staircase though Cleaning stairs is easy but for those with carpet a mini motorised tool would have been a useful addition Note that this vacuum cleaner can t stand up by itself the weight of the main vacuum and battery make it rather unstable It isn t any better when propped up against a wall either In fact when you re not cleaning I d advise that you lay the Vax ONEPWR Blade flat on the floor For storage there s a wall mount into which the vacuum cleaner s wand clips to help it stand upright The version supplied with the Blade Max didn t provide charging so you had to fumble around for the charging cable for the integrated battery There are no such concerns here the battery pops out of the back and plugs directly into the charging dock ready to be used with the Blade or any other ONEPWR accessory The simple wall mount is good for storage A battery charge meter on the back of the unit features four lights the provide a rough indicator to the vacuum s current charge level Once the battery is in the vacuum cleaner there s a secondary charge level display on the handle although confusingly this is made up of only three lights Vax ONEPWR Blade performance A decent cleaner but the more powerful Blade just edges it The main difference with the Vax ONEPWR Blade and the Blade is that this model doesn t have a brushless motor which makes the Blade a touch less powerful and slightly noisier too To review its cleaning prowess I put the ONEPWR Blade through my usual set of tests Starting with the carpet test I sprinkled a teaspoon of flour right up against the skirting board and drove the Vax ONEPWR Blade in a single pass through the mess I used it on standard power and turned on the motorised brush bar The single pass picked up a clean line through the dust although edge performance wasn t as good leaving behind a clump of flour Carpet test Dirty carpet left vs Clean carpet right move slider to compare Switching to Turbo power I attempted a second pass through but the mess however the dust remained showing this vacuum can t quite get close to the edge This remained true even when turning the vacuum cleaner s head perpendicular to the skirting board In the end I had to resort to using the crevice tool Next I threw a teaspoon of rice onto a hard floor I used the Vax ONEPWR Blade in standard mode to begin Although the vacuum manoeuvred through the mess leaving a relatively clean trail turning the power off resulted in several rice grains falling onto the floor I had to repeat this test on maximum power which produced better results although there were still one or two rice grains stuck in the grouting Hard floor test Dirty hard floor left vs Clean hard floor right move slider to compare Finally I tested the Vax ONEPWR Blade s ability to deal with pet hair Combing hair from my four cats into the carpet I used the vacuum cleaner on maximum power with the motorised brush turned on Sweeping through the vacuum managed to pick up the hair leaving a clean carpet behind Pet hair test Dirty carpet left vs Clean carpet right move slider to compare In terms of noise standard power on carpet with the brush head turned resulted in a reading of db Upping the power to Turbo the sound increased to dB The ONEPWR Blade makes quite a low mechanical rumble when turned on so it s difficult to hear above it The Blade with its brushless motor is a little quieter The Vax ONEPWR Blade ships with a Ah battery which gives a run time of minutes on standard power minutes on Turbo and takes hours to charge This should be sufficient to cover most areas in your home although I recommend a more powerful plug in cleaner for a deeper weekly clean To increase run time you can buy additional batteries Should you buy the Vax ONEPWR Blade There s no doubt that the Vax ONEPWR Blade is a decent vacuum cleaner and a handy add on to an existing plug in model I love the removable battery which brings flexibility particularly if you have other Vax ONEPWR tools such as the ONEPWR Glide hard floor cleaner For all that there s one very good reason not to buy the Blade the Vax ONEPWR Blade is better and costs only more Given that you get the bigger battery with the Blade and better pick up I d spend the extra and buy that vacuum instead The post Vax ONEPWR Blade appeared first on Trusted Reviews

12177,12177,Hello friends Welcome to a brand new week How was your weekend We took it really slow and it was lovely Over the past few weeks I ve been decluttering and cleaning places in our home that haven t gotten much attention It s been so nice to spruce up the backyard wipe down the table and chairs clean up the grill spray down the patio and watch the Star Jasmine bloom along the back fence We had several days of really nice weather so we colored Easter eggs outside It was definitely fun to wake up on Easter morning and have Jordan come running into my room so excited to see the eggs lining the hallway She was GIDDY These are some of the things I love most about age I had planned that we d all get dressed up in nice clothes on Sunday for at home church but alas we watched in the comfort of our jammies and that s okay too I must say although we are all distanced right now I felt so unified yesterday It literally brought me to tears I hope you had a wonderful day APRIL LOVES Today it s time for April Loves with a little surprise for you As a THANK YOU for reading and subscribing to my blog I m giving away EVERYTHING in my April Loves to one of my subscribers If you re not subscribed you can sign up here and I will pick a winner at random and announce at the end of the month If you re new to Loves it s where I share things I m loving each month with the aim to highlight fabulous things I swear by some things I want to try great deals and under finds All perfectly appropriate for the flavor of each month I love sourcing goodies and sharing them with you Pajama Set Sports Bra Candle Dry Shampoo Slippers Slide Sandals Younger Next Year Book Coin Necklace SuperGoop Unseen Sunscreen Pajama Set Not only are these pajamas the softest set around they are made in a factory that supports women worker empowerment through HERproject which creates partnerships to enable workplace based interventions on health financial inclusion and gender equality How amazing is that I also love the lightweight jersey knit feel of these and the piping details dresses them up just a bit Under and fit TTS Sports Bra It was a slow start but I ve upped my at home workout routine lately and I feel so much better Anyone else This Under Armor sports bra is the one I wear most often unless I m running It fits like a second skin is supportive and wicks away sweat quickly leaving you feeling dry during your workouts I also like the simple shape and skinnier racerback It also comes in several different colors to coordinate with any of your workout gear I m D and wear size Medium off sitewide code WFH25 Candle One of my favorite traditions at night and in the early morning is to light a candle I light a candle as soon as come downstairs after putting Jordan to bed in the evening and while I tidy the living room When I go to finally sit down at the end of the day it feels that much more soothing I also enjoy lighting a candle early in the morning or right before I sit down at my desk to begin working Anthropologie makes some of the best candles and one of their most popular scents is the Capri Blue Volcano I was the recipient of this big baby at our first Favorite Things Party and I ve been hooked ever since It s one of the only candles that I buy on repeat and have given many times as gifts It s hard to describe the scent but it s FRESH with tropical fruits sugared oranges lemons and limes redolent with lightly exotic mountain greens Dry Shampoo This is one of your beauty Must Haves and y all have been encouraging me to try it I finally bought a bottle really like it and I m picky about my dry shampoo I usually go about four days between washes and this helps with the in between times It helps give my hair volume and the powder feel absorbs the oils and odors And it smells great I ve been experimenting with applying it before bed and that s been working well Slippers Flip Flop Slippers Ummmm Yes please These are a staple for the summer months I always wear slippers at home because I don t like walking barefoot on my hardwood floors but I need a lighter pair since I m still in my UGGs These will keep your feet comfy while not overheating in a traditional slipper They also have a skid resistant bottom so you don t have to worry about slipping and sliding on your floors Under Slide Sandals I couldn t do a LOVES post without including my latest shoe obsession These criss cross slides are darling I ve been wearing them nonstop I had the traditional straight slide last year and wore the heck out of them They have a platform sole and a sporty chic vibe while being incredibly comfortable and supportive I got them in the natural buff color but they also come in white and black On sale under Younger Next Year Book I ve mentioned this book a few times already but it s truly so good and I think we could all benefit from reading it In fact I want to reread it The truth is that most of us will live into our mid s or s but HOW we live those years is largely in our control We can be vibrant and strong and in good shape with clear heads and guess what sexually active or be shuffling around on walkers depressed and fatigued This book lays out exactly what we need to be doing to enter these next decades with vitality and energy and gives you the science to back it up It s easy to digest and there s a good bit of humor in there too I always got a kick when they d refer to old Fred Coin Necklace If you ve been following my Stories you ve probably already noticed this coin pendant necklace I ve been wearing It s K gold and comes in a inch length but you can adjust it It s perfect alone or you can layer with your favorite choker style necklace The coin design is two palms off SuperGoop Unseen Sunscreen This is the sunscreen I ve been wearing you saw it in my skincare routine especially since we ve been going outside so much lately Daily bike rides have become one of our favorite things to do as a family Surprisingly Jordan is so fast Little speed demon I swear But anyway I don t want to age my skin any more than it already is and I know sun is the main culprit of hyperpigmentation so I wear this sunscreen with SPF Honestly I ve never worn a sunscreen that feels like this it s a very lightweight gel consistency that goes on invisibly It s also weightless and scentless and formulated with antioxidants that prep your skin for makeup It has a velvety finish that doesn t leave my skin feeling greasy or shiny And it provides broad spectrum protection and protection from blue light too Did

10975,10975,Apr GMT said Apr GMT said Gee you are fast you got to that before I even had a chance to edit typos Way to go You claim that TSA has never caught an attempt at an attack You have NO WAY of knowing that unless you work in the upper levels at TSA which I doubt Do you actually believe that they publicize every time they snag someone Do your local cops make headlines every time they bust a burglar or a dope dealer In big cities most MURDERS do not even make the paper unless the deceased is somebody famous of course Why would you think that TSA behaves any differently in this respect than any other cops It s also clear that you know even less about liquid explosives than I do I suggest that you Google the subject you will learn quite a bit in a fairly short time Onew of the things I learned in my short research into the subject the other night is that many of the potential explosives would not be smuggled onto the plane in the final explosive form they would be smuggled on by more than one person with separate components which would then be mixed on the plane But do not take my word for it Google is your friend Just enter the words liquid explosive in the search bar You will get an eyefull As far as The Patriot Act goes you and I are more ot less in agreement But if you think that there s ANY resemblance between the Patriot act and the Covid quarantine measures well lets just say that you have a comprehension problem and leave it at that There is NO MOTIVATION for any government to retain provisions that do not have a useful to the government result and actually INTERFERE with many of its goals Meh For the sake of discussion my father worked as police chief for a municipality near the Atlanta airport and worked with TSA GBI FBI etc regularly Some of the stories about TSA would make your hair stand up failure rates to catch fake bombs in security lines plain clothes police feds actively able to get past security doors and plant fake devices at key areas in the airport non working scanners that are there to make it look like there s more stringent testing going on etc TSA agents stealing millions of dollars worth of stuff trafficking humans animals drugs you name it TSA facilitates the worst of it It s theater and a farce of a safety administration Police secretly laugh at it the feds think it s a joke politicians love it because it makes people feel safe Ever wonder why the travel color condition never drops It was never designed to It was designed to keep people feeling like they need someone to protect them and government happily gives it to them in return for less pushback against tracking and surveillance But hey it s convinced you that there s some shadowy operation catching badguys behind the scenes and not telling us There ain t And yeah I made some explosives in my basement as a teenager It worked I would not dare look that stuff up now unless you wanted to be on a watchlist I am actually inclined to agree with a lot of that The implementation is seriously flawed It does not mean that the concept is wrong or that it s not effective in discouraging terrorist activity It still happens from time to time in parts of the world that DO not have such obvious airport security Malaysia Air would be a good example The thing is disappeared flights often do not go down as hijackings in the statistics

EG 6 allotments if only a couple years of chart-12 monthsallotmnts of many years of charts and find the all time LOW of each period and draw a line between each of those ATL's . there you will find good indication of where 'VALUE' is. because no one is foolish to sell for less than it cost them to obtain it. again for emphasis ignore the ATH (bubble price).. look for the ALT(value waterline) then that will help you guage comparing ATL of most recent period, evaluate if all periods are on a upward or downward movement. then compare the most recent ATL to the current price and then comparing the current price to the ATH price you can then see if the price is at a nice discount (near value) or if its way too much of a premium(near ATH)"

5647,5647,Abstract Objectives Transcription of eukaryotic protein coding genes by RNA polymerase II pol II is highly regulated at initiation elongation and termination Transcription is also coordinated with co transcriptional processing of the emerging pre mRNA by capping splicing and cleavage and polyadenylation Polyadenylation poly A site recognition which defines the end of the mRNA relies on the cleavage and polyadenylation CPA complex It was previously observed that knocking down proteins of the CPA complex affects not only recognition of the poly A site but also results in increased pausing of pol II at the beginning of genes This finding suggests that the CPA complex plays a role in regulating pol II turnover after transcription initiation Data description To explore this possibility we knocked down a subunit of the cleavage factor I CFIm CFIm68 which is part of the CPA complex and involved in alternative polyadenylation and performed pol II ChIP seq in absence or presence of a transcription elongation inhibitor In addition we performed pol II ChIP qPCR on a subset of protein coding genes after knocking down CFIm68 Objective Transcription of a eukaryotic protein coding gene by pol II requires several steps including transcription initiation elongation and termination During transcription co transcriptional processes such as mRNA capping splicing and cleavage and polyadenylation also occur and are required for the production of a mature mRNA The end of a protein coding gene is defined by one or more poly A sites and recognition of a poly A site is essential for the cleavage and polyadenylation of the mRNA Approximately proteins make up the cleavage and polyadenylation CPA complex and are distributed between four multi subunits complexes that regulate poly A site recognition pre mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation The four complexes are cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor CPSF cleavage stimulation factor CstF and cleavage factors I CFIm and II CFIIm CFIm is composed of two CFIm25 subunits which binds the pre mRNA and two larger subunits CFIm59 and CFIm68 CFIm binds the pre mRNA nt upstream of the poly A site but its role in pre mRNA cleavage remains unclear However previous studies have shown a shift towards proximal poly A site usage following depletion of CFIm25 or CFIm68 suggesting a role of CFIm in promoting distal poly A site recognition and longer mRNA UTRs Some proteins of the CPA complex including CstF64 CPSF73 and the CPA associated termination factor Xrn2 have been shown to regulate pol II activity at the beginning and end of the transcription cycle To determine whether depletion of CFIm also affects pol II pausing and transcription we used a CRISPR Cas9 approach to reduce the expression of two subunits of CFIm CFIm25 and CFIm68 and performed pol II ChIP seq in the CFIm68KD cell line in absence or presence of an inhibitor of cyclin dependent kinase CDK whose activity regulates pol II pause release and entry into productive elongation Data description Cell culture HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco s Modified Eagle s Medium DMEM Sigma supplemented with fetal bovine serum FBS Gibco and units ml penicillin + ¬µg ml streptomycin Gibco The CFIm68KD cell lines and its respective control HEK293 Flp were previously described The cell lines were treated prior to ChIP seq with DMSO or ¬µM dichlorobenzimidazone Œ≤ d ribofuranoside DRB Sigma for min Table Table Overview of data files

379,379,"Here are a couple of cases where it is convenient to inject tokens into the input stream. (How this is actually integrated into the parsing pipeline is another question.) Macro expansion, in the style of the C/C++ preprocessing phase. This is arguably not the best model for macro expansion; hygienic macros would more likely be expanded using a tree transformation, as with C++ template resolution. But the token-oriented preprocessor is not going away soon. Since it is not tightly coupled with the language syntax, the easiest implementation is to substitute the macro (and arguments if applicable) with the tokens from its expansion. Ecmascript-style automatic semi-colon insertion (ASI). The language syntax requires a semi-colon to be inserted into the token stream under certain precisely-defined circumstances, which are difficult (at least) to incorporate in a CFG. Since ASI is only possible if the next token in the input stream cannot be shifted (and done other conditions), it can certainly be integrated into the parser loop. Similarly, indentation-aware block syntax (as in Haskell and Python, for example) can certainly be implemented by replacing leading whitespace with an injected INDENT token or some number of injected DEDENTs. Since this substitution is dependent on parse context (it isn't done inside parentheses, for example), injection inside the parser could be a reasonable approach. That's not an exhaustive list, but it might be at least indicative. Not all of those cases necessarily involve context-sensitivity (I believe ASI could, in theory, be handled with a context-free grammar although I have no intention of trying) and not all instances of context-sensitivity necessarily require token injection (the ambiguity in C between type and variable names only requires selecting the correct token)."

4888,4888,"As a believer in real money*, I'm definitely a Jim Grant fan - - here's an excerpt from today's column: The dollar is another historical anomaly. It was first defined as a weight of silver, next as a weight of gold. Then, in 1971, it was undefined. It became a piece of paper or a line of computer code‚Äîunconnected to the precious metals, its value is what the market says it is. Will you trust that piece of paper in the next bout of inflation? Having pushed aside the silver standard and the gold standard, the world today is on a Ph.D. standard. The central bankers and their theories come straight from the university economics departments (Jay Powell, to his credit, is neither economist nor professor). In response to the events of 2008, the doctors of economics pressed down interest rates and held them down. Cheap capital built leveraged, loss-making businesses. Private equity boomed. How will these bull-market creations fare in the face of higher rates, tighter credit, and cyclically stunted revenue growth? We are going to find out. This column, in sum, judges that the July 2016 low in rates marked the start of a new, perhaps lengthy bond bear market, with lots of volatility along the way. * JP Morgan: ""Money is gold, and nothing else."""

Sitting at a small desk to the side was Xenoaisam, his assistant and friend. She was doing the simple gruntwork, reviewing reports and forwarding the important ones to Metal, or sending replies in his name for the less important ones. A small beep would indicate the arrival of a message from none other than the uprising's second. ""Commander."" ""Hm? Yes, Xeno?"" ""There is a message from the Captain."" ""Mags?"" A nod. ""Forward it to me."" With a flick of her hand, the message was sent to Metal's display, the Wily tapping the message and opening it, reading the contents slowly and carefully, his eyebrows lifting. ""Xeno, prepare transport, we're heading to the detention center."" Closing out her screens, Xeno stood and tucked a small data pad into her side pouch.

3693,3693,Pandemics have historically brought out racist and xenophobic tendencies COVID has sparked conspiracy theories against Chinese and Jewish populations around the world Racist tropes spread online have real world consequences that are harming communities In the fourth and fifth centuries Christians were called upon to practice alousia Known as the state of being unwashed the only time these faithful were allowed to bathe was during baptism Any other instance of putting soap and water together for the sake of cleansing one s skin according to The Dirt on Clean by Katherine Ashenburg signified vanity and worldliness Humans have always had strange bathing rituals or lack thereof As one instance of the bubonic plague claimed million European lives in the th century the University of Paris s medical faculty discovered the cause the conjunction of Saturn Jupiter and Mars caused disease infected vapors to rise out of the earth and waters and poison the air The most susceptible Anyone taking hot baths which opened the pores and allowed the vapors to penetrate There was a two century stretch in which Europeans refused to bathe Muslims and Jews both with their own extensive histories of cleansing rituals long suspected their Christian neighbors of being filthy Not that early Christians left their peers off easily They believed these silly rituals with soap and oils and water were the actual source of scourge Dirtiness was divine So long as their linen shirts were cleaned and pressed whatever went on beneath was as nature intended Nature does not intend so much as adjusts Bacteria and viruses could not care less about rituals Their goal is to proliferate not pontificate While today we have course corrected too far thanks to an obsession with antibacterial soap good hygiene has always been wrapped up with mysticism and ritual as well as racism David Patrikarakos points out that the bubonic plague provided an opportunity to scapegoat Jewish communities which have long been subject to unfair scrutiny Hundreds of Jewish communities perished too he writes their inhabitants slaughtered out of hatred and fear The Black Death was yet another in a series of instances that rebirthed an ancient idea that the Jews are to blame Strange ideas about cleanliness persist For instance in early twentieth century France dirt was thought to nourish your hair The anti aging protocol du jour involved keeping your skin as oily as possible Our neuroses about health always seem to get the best of us A recent Pew study discovered that roughly percent of Americans believe that COVID was created in a laboratory Again a profound misunderstanding of nature in this case our relationship with other animals As Patrikarakos notes Turkish state run television recently promoted the idea that Jews and Zionists engineered the novel coronavirus to neuter the world s population An Algerian news outlet jumped on the same bandwagon Never to be outdone some American pastors and Reddit commentators always the cr√®me of our nation them believe the pandemic is God s way of exterminating Jews By this point you d think the Big Guy would have been able to handle that directive Let us not leave out the Chinese who have taken the brunt of this current aggression The Chinese virus rhetoric coming from the White House has real world consequences for Chinese Americans and relationships with China broadly That does not mean as Bill Maher suggested last week we cannot use the geographical location in naming the virus He lists plenty of examples Zika is from the Zika Forest Ebola from the Ebola River hantavirus the Hantan River There s the West Nile virus and Guinea worm and Rocky Mountain spotted fever and of course the Spanish flu Maher s larger point is relevant and unfortunately absent in many discussions regarding this pandemic It s possible to both recognize that this virus appears to have originated in an exotic animal market a danger that we have been warned about since at least specific to Chinese markets by researchers in Hong Kong no less and not be racist and xenophobic We can work toward banning food stalls that threaten public health without abandoning Chinese restaurants in America Yet it does not appear that we are able to hold two ideas in our heads anymore While I do not have extensive experience debating on a stage I recall an essential part of the training you have to argue whatever point you are assigned This sometimes means arguing for a perspective you are personally against The best debaters learn this skill The rest spend their time trolling on social media Debate prep arms you with critical thinking skills necessary for navigating a confusing and at times contradictory world It forces you to stop reacting emotionally after reading the lede of an article without bothering to click through We have reached as Patrikarakos writes regarding the invented DC pizzeria pedophile ring the perfect embrace of the sinister and the absurd Thus next to posts about G killing birds false and causing coronavirus false and Bill Gates being sued by India false and vaccines causing autism false the ultimate conspiracy must be between the Chinese government and Zionists tanking the global economy in order to to Writing about smallpox in th century Britain Ashenburg writes that the unintended transmission of disease in this case through the eyes of Charles Dickens s novel Bleak House is a forceful reminder that the neglect of its weakest members makes society as a whole vulnerable Along the way we finally recognized that soap and water is necessary for public health Now if only we can find the magic formula that ends our toxic love affair for racist and xenophobic conspiracy theories during times of pandemics and otherwise Stay in touch with Derek on Twitter and Facebook His next book is Hero s Dose The Case For Psychedelics in Ritual and Therapy

In theory this is true, in practise however, there're 2 problems: a) how many purples are in the game (with FG approaching 1k)? How many do you find in an average run? So, the probability of finding the same purple in another session ) Obviously, GDStash/Item Assist. The game doesnt care if you already have 24 of that same purple in your virtual stash. TL;DR: if you want to squeeze out the last 0.01% go on, but it's not worth the trouble, at least my .2‚Ç¨ a) this is totally contradicting my personal experience. I keep finding certain purples over and over again. Still I haven't seen every purple dropping yet at least once. I find it also quite interesting how different poeple are. I for example WANT to squeeze out the last tiny bit. If I find an item that rolled better I will change to it. I also keep hunting for certain MIs for that particular reason. That is what makes me keep playing this game. And I have like 20 toons so there's plenty of farming to do ;-)"

8902,8902,Hello I hosted a party last night and something strange happened During the first hour we were serving non alcoholic drinks there was no alcohol at the party Most people were sitting at the kitchen table but my sister and her boyfriend ~ years old were at the island counter top in the middle of the kitchen where most people could not see what they were doing I turned around and I saw that he had a small cylindrical silver vial about long and maybe wide It had a screw top and the top part had a brush on it it resembled a mascara brush but smaller He was pouring the silver liquid into his drink I noticed that the vial was silver and the liquid was also silver Two scenarios The vial was an opaque silver and the liquid was as well OR The vial was transparent and the liquid was silver I also noticed that the silver liquid sat on top of the lemonade so maybe that is a clue about density Also he was using brush part of the vial to get more out so that could possible show that it is a viscous liquid I asked him what it was He hesitated and said Flavored oils I am an experimentalist My first thought was that he was going to roofie my sister but I saw that he was drinking out of that cup Another guest said that they saw my sister drinking out of the same cup I can not guarantee that my sister saw her boyfriend put the stuff in his drink This guy is not someone I trust Nobody in my family except my sister likes this guy Both my sister and this guy were acting strange throughout the party and they ended up in her room for most of the party I do not care if they had sex or whatever but if he roofied her then I will have a problem In the past this guy has lashed out at my sister He makes her pay for his Lyft train rides all the time overall my family does not see him as a stable person After he had left she was in her room sleeping as far as I can tell Facts to know Cylindrical vial about tall and wide cm tall cm wide The vial had two parts The bottom was long and had a threaded top The top was the cap and had a brush on it as well Either the vial itself was opaque silver AND the liquid was silver OR the vial was transparent and the liquid was silver I distinctly remember it being shiny when looking at the vial The liquid was a bit more of a grayish when in the drink but that could be because it was distributed over the drink He only put a few drops in his drink He had to use the brush part to scoop more out of the vial Maybe it s a viscous fluid The liquid sat on top of his lemonade Could be less dense than the lemonade or just because he only put a few drops What kind of flavored oil is SILVER Why would he only bring a very small vial of it Why would he hesitate when I asked him what it was Why would a silver liquid like that have a brush Unless that is not the vial it came in One of my other sisters suggested that maybe it was hemp oil Not sure if that s something you would put in a drink or if that would be silver

Comparing the European immigrant experience to blacks, hispanics, Native American, Chinese, Japanese, etc. is a joke. Learn some history: ? How many other immigrant groups in American has this occurred: Immigrants move to U.S. (1830s); 2nd generation child (1858-1929) who has been allowed to prosper in business and politics; 3rd generation anti-Semite (1888-1969) who used family connections to prosper in business, government, and Hollywood; 4th generation U.S. president (1917-1963) and siblings who had powerful careers in government. You're right, the Irish faced the same ceiling as POC immigrant groups. And by the way, as for the fake news: ""No Irish Need Apply"": A Myth of Victimization : Every up and coming group has faced discrimination. The Irish, the Catholics, the Jews, Blacks, and Hispanics. Asians are no exception. So, these grouped faced discrimination and persevered. So yes, I am saying first generation Irish-Americans, like most immigrants, faced discrimination. I'm not saying they do today. Same with Catholics. There wasn't a Catholic on the Supreme Court for 150 years, and now there are about to be 6 of them. I can agree with first generation immigrants historically facing discrimination. However, when it comes to matters of race, you can't assimilate they same way, and the discrimination continues in perpetuity. +1"

7817,7817,"ROOT SMUDGE ‚Ä¢ What is a root smudge?? A root smudge is a service performed at the bowl (usually) alongside your toner. What we do is apply a root color close to the natural color of the hair to blend, or ‚Äúsmudge‚Äù the root and the highlights together for a seamless transition. ‚Ä¢ What does this do?? Basically, a root smudge is going to give you a much softer grow-out to your hair! When we do traditional foils, your hair will have a LINE of demarcation when it grows out. A root smudge is going to soften this line & give a more natural LIVED IN look. üòå ‚Ä¢ Who is this for?? This is perfect for my low-maintenance girls who only get their color done a few times a year! It‚Äôs also great for anyone trying to achieve a ‚Äúbalayage‚Äù look, but isn‚Äôt a good candidate for open air/hand painted balayage! ‚Ä¢ Here, we were able to make her feel nice & blonde by keeping her face framing foils super bright & close to the root, but give her less maintenance and a soft grow-out by doing a root smudge on the rest of the head! She‚Äôll be able to grow this out seamlessly & just come in for a toner every few months to freshen up, and about 3-4 times a year for her actual blonding service! ü§ó Side note: Look how BOMB her makeup is üòª"

3440,3440,Photographed By Lula Hyers During our conversation Hayley Mandel tells me no less than three times that they want to change the world After a just a few minutes of chatting it s clear they will The model appears in Refinery29 s newest No Apologies Collection an expansion of the Project in partnership with Getty Images The collection aims to diversify stock photo depictions of beauty fashion sex and intimacy and women s health showing more realistic imagery of the human experience and a more accurate portrayal of the lives of readers Mandel features in the sex and intimacy section of the project officially launching in February which is fitting since their internet presence heavily grapples with body image sensuality and a brazen openness about sex as a queer plus size non binary person The model is equally as honest over the phone talking rapidly like someone who finally got the chance to speak during a conversation at a party In a way that s exactly what s happening The year old is quick to point out that the industry has long been dominated by cis skinny heterosexual women but now it s their turn You are in school What are you studying It s kind of up in the air but I am most likely going to go the English and gender studies route I want to write really badly I do not want to be a writer but I want to write I want to change the world Where have you written I have written for a couple of my friends zines not like big zines just a couple of zines and very very small college literary journals This year I really think is going to be my year to break more into the scene I am just not quite sure how to do it but I would really like to What s it like to be a plus size model in the industry I struggle calling myself a model because okay I do not know if I struggle to call myself a model because I am not doing as much work as models There s just so little representation of bodies of my specific kind of body in modeling that it s like Can I really call myself a model I do not really want to be a straight model I think that you know Barbie Nox right She s tweeted something about how modeling is great but that s not how she wants to change the world And that s kind of how I feel Advertisement I WILL NEVER QUIT I WILL ONLY CONTINUE UNTIL I TAKE OVER THE WORLD BUT MODELING DEF WONT BE THE WAY I DO IT TBH burbie October What about when it comes to modeling for these stock photos I am more than happy to pose for people and I do really enjoy it and I get a lot of pleasure out of it I mean I am totally ruled by Venus I get a lot of pleasure out of modeling and I think it s really fun and I think it s really important especially with these stock photos because stock photos are so often homogenous for lack of a better word Have these homogenous depictions in media affected you I think that to live in this American society to say that unrealistic beauty standards to say that the diet industry to say that capitalism basically does not affect you is to be in denial For me as a fat person especially a fat femme absolutely I went to a school where I was truly the fattest kid there or maybe was like one of three fat kids out of literally the entire school And I definitely recognize my privilege and that I am white I am upper middle class I am femme I have a pretty classically beautiful face and a classic hourglass figure But I am still pounds and like I think maybe part of the reason I struggle to call myself a model is because I just cannot see myself being like I am not going to lose weight I already know this I have a lot of hormonal issues where it s assured that if I wanted to lose weight it would be a road paved with much hardship which it has been in the past When I was in high school I had a pretty real eating disorder that I do not ever talk about literally I do not think anyone knows about it But no one would believe me because I am fat There s systemic abuse for fat children because they are fat and because this anti fatness culture is so pervasive so yeah That s how it s affected me Advertisement Photographed By Lula Hyers Growing up were there any positive depictions in media that inspired you or did you have to create your own I think honestly I had to create my own images because I think it was more subconscious that I noticed that well I will just start from the beginning I do not fit in anywhere I have never felt that I really fit even in groups of friends I just do not feel like I really fit And I think part of that has always been because I have always been the fat kid And fat people are and this is never talked about fat people are dehumanized to an extreme like to an extreme I know that I need to create my own images of what I need to see because there s a teenage girl or person out there that follows me on Instagram and is seeing their body finally represented on the internet I need people to see that even throughout the truly massive amounts of hate that I get I feel like yes I have really had to create these images for myself because it s been vital to my life I probably would not be alive honestly I do not think I would be alive if I did not take a lot of care to document my body and myself as like a human being and someone with nuance not just a caricature so that a teenage girl in I do not know Idaho or something can be looking on the internet which is both a scary and amazing place and be like Oh shit there s someone who is owning the fact that they are considered obese they are sexy they are nuanced they are funny they are smart they can model I can do all of these things that people do not expect You are also very open about mental health and mental illness online specifically on Instagram When did you decide to start talking about it I have realized that the more you do not talk about something you think about it a lot the more it s just gonna build up I think I started talking more openly about my mental health a couple years ago when I went to this school that for some reason was rife with sexual pressures more than I had ever come across I am a rape victim multiple times over and just have a lot of sexual trauma so I kind of lost my shit That s when I experienced my first psychotic episode I was assaulted there I thought that I was going to do something drastic and I realized that I wasn t talking to anyone at this point I was not in therapy I did not have an outlet because the people I was friends with a couple of them were great but I was not in a safe environment to be talking about any of this So I started using the internet as a vehicle to talk about this especially because this was during a time where if I wasn t in therapy I wasn t working through any trauma So it became this very public bearing witness to my mental illness and my trauma and my fatness being like Look at me This is what you think is ugly and I need you to look at this and I need you to be just as disgusted by it as I am and I need you to know why you are disgusted by it What do you hope people are learning about body image and mental illness by following you I hope people are uncomfortable I do Obviously not bad uncomfortable But at the same time no growth comes out of comfort If you are comfortable you are not growing That is probably my main mantra When people go onto my Instagram page I need them to be uncomfortable I need them to look at my page especially because I grew up in an environment like I said I am upper middle class and I am white and I fully recognize that I just need the people that I grew up with especially who were so horrible to me and who were all skinny and all cis and straight and whatever to like I just need them to see that It is like a deep deep need within me for people to grow and to make people uncomfortable because this is reality Photographed By Lula Hyers I feel like my whole life people have been like Hayley stop or you are being dramatic basically gaslighting me But I am not going to stop Literally The day I die will be the day I stop yelling about issues that directly affect fat and mentally ill communities and communities that are marginalized The day I die will be the day I stop talking about it People need to know this I know my power and I know that I have the power to change something and to make an impact on someone who is fat and who is mentally ill or who is

8720,8720,"The sneak peek comes courtesy of a behind-the-scenes video that provides a look not just at a daiquiri-drinking Quinn, but at all of the supporting characters, too. Robbie also posted a shot of the new look on her Instagram. If you will recall, Harley Quinn herself, Margot Robbie, shared with us not that long ago the film's actual title and it is a mouthful: Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn ). Along with her signature baseball cap, heart tattoo, and red lips, in the new images, Harley Quinn sports a bright pink and red, confetti-fringed outfit, a silver choker and a new haircut. This comes alongside the drop of the short teaser trailer for the upcoming film which gives us a brief look at some of the main characters including Robbie's Harley Quinn, Mary Elizabeth Winstead's Huntress, and Jurnee Smollett-Bell's Black Canary. In the teaser video, called ""See You Soon"", an '80s pop beat plays over quick glimpses of the cast in full costume. ""Miss me? HQ"", she captioned the pic. On Monday, a Birds of Prey teaser was published on YouTube, which revealed the Queenpin's trendy makeover and introduced key DC female superheroes, including Black Canary and Huntress. Officially titled "" Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn )"", there's a good chance that the movie will see a Harley Quinn liberated from her often toxic relationship with the Joker. So there you have it. Margot Robbie's character in Birds of Prey looks slightly different.

6003,6003,"This is a reply to AdvertisementHolistic Health Invention Will Change Your Life The Tesla Shield‚Ñ¢ Transformational Technology For Mind Body And Soul Insects and Fungi contain Chitin as shells This is the way they protect themselves from the human immune system which has no enzymes to dissolve the chitin This paper describes symbiotic or common complicated infections of chitin infections Fungal filarial mite So these infections have a common element Chitin One of the few enzymes break it down in the body is Chitinase IMMUNE System Several immune pathways are disturbed and require alteration through natural substances Chitin pathogens produced and secreted IL TNF alpha and IFN gamma suppressed the production of T helper Th cytokines To combat a chitin induced infection alteration of the immune system needs to be counteracted Chitin administration significantly reduced allergen induced serum IgE levels and lung inflammation Th1 cytokines IL IFN and TNF were elevated while IL levels were decreased in mice administered chitin as compared to controls Chitinase activity was reported to be unregulated as a result of various diseases including candidiasis Wuchereria bancrofti infections filariasis and helminth infections FYI I had candida now still have Onychomycosis It took a year to eliminate candida from the body this is essential for basic body processes I have yet to go after onychomycosis I also have filariasis If foot fungus gets out of control I use clove bud oil on the feet Co infections and structural weakness in the immune system lead to certain infection types Chitin pathogens tend to all present when there is an immune weakness There are usually key immune alterations by taking certain supplements that can drastically change an illness progression For example For Candida natural substances like castor oil caprylic acid undecenoic acid Coconut butter other oils help with fungal infections Fungal and Chitin issues are also opposed by beta glucans turkey tail mushrooms and others Paul Stammes has a good mushroom supplement here Vitamin D may also help with some of the immune system alteration but other substances may be required as well Try IU D vitamin D DEC IVM and ALB may be required for filaria only WHO protocol calls for a single dose every months DEC at mg kg ALB at mg kg IVM at ucg KG it can take years to eliminate filarial infections provided there are no complicated infections like I have Hair analysis is essential to have body balance in minerals and metals Magnesium Potassium Copper Zinc Iodine etc etc must all be in balance Detox pathways Urea loop Citric cycle other pathways are dealt with using daily routines Nitrogen Vs Sulfur is something I have written about NH5 NH4 are broken down into basic form NH2 through Piperazines even natural form Vitamin D increases Nitric Acid which tells parasitic nematode worms to slow their metabolism as a natural regulation mechanism Low dose Thyme or Oregano usually helps lower systemic bacterial levels Lufenuron with IVM doses per the CCWS protocol may be helpful Boron powder and clothes washing application externally may help weaken infestation areas Try oregano oil and castor oil mixed applied externally this also may help clear areas over many weeks The key to your success may require immune boosting and signaling alteration I have spent years identifying and selecting substances that alter parasitic infections I have no idea which substances beyond candida Certainly a persistent mite infection is an order of magnitude increase of infection of a chitin pathogen Swietenia mahogany extract Magnolia bark extract Rose hip seed tea Stinging Nettle Root mg Caps Item SW968 > tea > Stinging nettle robs fungus of hard outer shell chitinin To make sure I look for some more advice I did a few quick searches From my database In the common pill bug Wolbachia can have a feminizing effect turning males into females In some mites the bacteria induce parthenogenesis a process by which females breed asexually without the genetic contribution of males In mosquitoes males and females infected with Wolbachia must possess the same strain to successfully reproduce ‚Äî if there's a mismatch the bacteria will sabotage the male's sperm effectively sterilizing him Can infect Mites Triclosan can help break down chitin papaya helps certain people Seed extract oil Flagyl in short dose reported to help bust mite infection Facebook has a group Human Parasites which has some focus on mites mite file query A tea tree oil product Cliradex can be used marigolds Juniper leaf essential oil ‚Ä¢ Camphor used in cooking is 'edible camphor' It is also called 'pachchai karpooram' pachcha karpooram pachai karpuram or pacha karpuram Pachchai in Tamil means raw or green Lufeneron ivermectin moxidectin Eucalyptus oil and Almond Oil and combine the two making it as strong as you can endure with the Eucalyptus oil I do not know what it does but it caused the parasite activity under my skin to greatly reduce Also by my eyes not too close it ll burn there was a host of tiny white mites that died off after moisturizing my face with this mixture I did this routine into my third day of Humaworm i am not sure which of the two cures is responsible but it reduced the itching and ticklish feeling tremendously ‚Ä¢ In some cultures it was customary to bathe in chaparral once per year to eliminate skin parasites and to detoxify however there is no modern research demonstrating the effectiveness of this use of chaparral Ivermectin has one of the broadest clinical antiparasitic spectrums known It includes gastrointestinal parasites such as ascarids adult large strongyles adult th stage larvae of small strongyles pinworms large stomach worms hair worms and immature stages of stomach bots It is also effective against parasites that end up in the skin or lungs For example the immature form of onchocerca which causes summer dermatitis in horses is removed as are lung worms Several parasites that live in or on the skin are also affected e g cattle grubs lice and mites Some stages of some blood borne filarids e g immature Dirofilaria immitis are removed Mechanism of Action Ivermectin causes tonic paralysis of peripheral musculature in nematodes and ectoparasites ticks mites insects It potentiates release and action of GABA In vertebrates such neurons and receptors are in the CNS where ivermectin achieves low concentrations Ivermectins are ineffective in cestodes and trematodes perhaps because they lack GABA mediated control of peripheral musculature Although well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract they cross the blood brain barrier poorly They are eliminated primarily in the feces in animals There is little data from human studies Adverse effects Ivermectins are relatively safe for species that have an approved dose form horse dog cattle and swine They have no known teratogenic effect in these species There is evidence of substantial teratogenicity in mice rats and rabbits the species most commonly used for preclinical testing Brown At high doses the ivermectins can cause CNS signs including lethargy ataxia mydriasis tremors and death Adverse effects in horses of an injectable form that is no longer avilable may represent signs that could be seen with overdose Louisiana study These signs include eyelid edema fever increased rate and depth of respiration disorientation signs of colic extreme depression and death within minutes Death occurred in horse of treated Description of the Prior Art The treatment of scabies is usually accomplished by the application of medicaments to the skin Gamma benzene hexachloride is the most extensively used scabicide Other drugs used are crotamiton benzyl benzoate and sulfur Although each of these drugs is effective in the treatment of scabies each has its shortcomings gamma benzene hexachloride is not rapidly antipruritic scabies mites are becoming relatively resistant to it and it has the potential for being toxic to the central nervous system of infants crotamiton is sensitizing and sulfur is unpleasantly odoriferous and stains As already mentioned levamisole S 5 6 tetrahydro phenylimidazo b thiazole with the following structure used in accordance with the present invention for the treatment of scabies in humans and other mammals has been in use around the world for years as an anthelmintic with few or no adverse side effects While no accepted theory for its effectiveness against scabies has yet been proven one theory postulated herein is that this activity may be related to its recently reported ability to restore host resistance as discussed in several of the publications cited above Thus for example at the International Conference on Scabies held at the Mayo Memorial Auditorium of the University of Minnesota on May it was suggested that immune system incompetence may play a role in the pathogenesis of scabies On the other hand levamisole may act directly on the mite i e as a scabicide Bartonella can be found in fleas ticks biting flies mosquitoes lice mites and chiggers ""We"" are bacteria It is a matter of whether or not we are living in harmony with them Chitinase is a digestive enzyme which breaks down glycosidic bonds in chitin Due to chitin being a component of the cell walls of fungi and exoskeletal elements of some animals including worms and arthropods chitinases are usually found in organisms that either need to remake their own chitin or to dissolve and digest the chitin of fungi or animals Chitinivorous organisms include many bacteria genuses such as Aeromonas Bacillus Vibrio among others which may be pathogenic or detritivorous Chitinase expression is mediated by the NPR1 gene and the salicylic acid pathway both of which are involved in resisting fungal and insect attack Human chitinases appear in gastric juices They are likely to be digestive chitinases for catabolic activity Chitinase activity is identified systemically in humans in the blood and possibly cartilage Chitinase has been related to allergies asthma in particular has been linked to enhanced chitinase expression levels also dust mites and mold spores which are both chitin covered Chitinase Clostridium Paraputrificum Recombinant fused with a His tag at N terminus produced in E Coli is a single non glycosylated polypeptide chain containing amino acids and having a molecular mass of kDa The Chitinase is purified by proprietary chromatographic techniques Escherichia Coli Sterile Filtered White

385,385,"We love to eat Macadamian nuts but what other benefits do they have for your skinü§ìü§ì?! Skin Benefits of Macadamia Nut Oil Macadamia nut oil is a lightweight oil, that is well absorbed without feeling greasy. It‚Äôs high in monounsaturated fatty acids, including Oleic Acid (Omega 9), which are very moisturising, regenerating and softening on the skin. These fatty acids also have anti-inflammatory properties. The Linoleic Acid (Omega 6) in Macadamia nut oil helps to restore the skin‚Äôs barrier function and reduce water loss. Macadamia nut oil also contains Palmitoleic Acid (Omega 7), an active anti-microbial that is found naturally in youthful skin. Palmitoleic Acid (Omega 7) levels in our skin reduce with age, contributing to the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles and weathered skin. Macadamia nut oil has been shown to slow the signs of ageing and has also been used to improve the appearance of scars, sunburn and other minor skin irritations."

I can understand from other posts that there is slightly more room on the V6 models. It also seems that the front wheels will be the limiting factor. I dont intend to lower the car. I am aware of ET etc. so let us assume the wheel can be positioned optimal ET with spacers. The original max spec is 225/45-17 on 7.5x17 ET29 wheels and if possible I would like to exceed that. Would for instance 8x18 rims or even 8.5x18 rims be possible? They would then be fitted with for instance 225/35-18 or 235/35-18 wheels. (I am aware that it needs to keep somewhat same diameter) [URL unfurl=""true""] [/URL] Does anyone have this size mounted? Would it give me problems when turning etc? Does anyone have the BOLA TX09 mounted? (see link) Is there more room for the rear wheels (if we assume that it is legal to change size between front and back)? Thanks in advance :)"

Even so, the toxins released by this debacle threaten to poison the court, and the country, for years to come.

237,237,"Good evening, We completed a two week trip last year ( CHC > Hokitika > Fox > Wanaka > QTN > Mt Cook > CHC) and loved it SO SO much we are back this year! We loved the scenery, it was our first road trip style of holiday and really enjoyed driving and making heaps of spontaneous stops. We could only have a short break from work so have 5 nights which isn't ideal but I have the following itinerary I'm playing with. There really isn't much info/trip reports about the Catlin's as there are other SI destinations so I'm wondering if we just spend the whole time in Mt Cook which we LOVED or do this , 21 Oct - Arrive QTN 1pm, get hire car and drive to Te Anau (traveling from Brisbane) Tues, 22 Oct - Leave hotel at 6:30am to do 9am cruise. Stops along the route on the way back. Overnight in Te Anau (possible glow worm tour) Weds 23 Oct - Depart Te Anau for the Catlins with the following possible stops; -Waipapa Point Lighthouse - seals -Slope Point (20min return walk) -Curio Bay (petrified forrest & Porpoise Bay for hector dolphins) -McLean Falls (40min return walk) -Cathedral Cove ($5 3pm to 7pm roughly) -Purakaunui Falls Walk (10min return walk) -Cannibal Bay or Surat Bay - seals -Nugget Point (lighthouse 40min return walk) Where to overnight??? We enjoy the busy driving and stopping style of road trip, with not much to do of a night time in small towns I don't want to book somewhere in the middle and spend half the afternoon bored. Thurs, 24 Oct - ? Fri, 25 Oct - ? Sat, 26 Oct - Fly out of QTN at 1pm (wouldn't mind spending the Fri night in QTN, we got married on Cecil Peak last year and would be special to do another helicopter flight if time is available there) Unsure what to do with a couple of those days - Dunedin doesn't look too interesting but its too far to go anywhere else (Mt Cook)? Thank you all in advance, TA was such a great help with our trip last year and I appreciate your time and advice!"

2954,2954,In reply to Bro Hi Bro I ll give you my own take on your questions here How is it possible for so many extras and dancers and actors to participate in such utter shit And Superbowl audiences in the stadiums to actually cheer it on I think it s part and parcel of a developed streak in the Anglo society of a supposed rebellion against the hierarchy It started in the s and although young I did see it They weren t going to wear the conservative clothes of oldies as those who fought and suffered in a war to bring them freedom were called in tones of disrespect In clothing in public behaviour in doing drugs once the preserve of a few arty types to be In and Hip you had to have a record for smoking marijuana They admired the scruffy with long hair and torn jeans but could strum a guitar and mouth words of rebellion that often didn t make much sense Now in it s way this was OK just an historic time of change but it but brought more extremes Rates of single parenting went up and the so called Gothic look now a deliberate attempt to make yourself look ugly in the extreme And gothicism was derived from movies of ghouls vampires evil Suddenly it was cool or indeed wicked to admire the purports of Evil and Satanism However few seemed to realise that attendance at any Church was dropping through the floor Churches in fact were beginning to close because belief was going Along with a cool rejection of Christ a Godhead the teachings of religion was the same rejection of anything like Evil often said to be just a control meme of the wealthy or any realisation that Evil exists Much of this spread to schools of Arts Theatre Acting So those young people in orange suits prison or street worker are probably from such outlets I dont think they have any idea of the truth of the undercurrent They just think to portray something in a completely outlandish way that shocks those of the conservative collective is cool creative challenging brilliant I think again they are just being used because they ve been taught to look no further into anything Again those cheering it on are probably carefully selected to be from the same sort of cool outrageous people Why is this public display and celebration of evil needed by the NWO oligarchy I dont know that it is Is it just the Oligarchy or is it more widespread What are the vulnerabilities IN OURSELVES that cause in most cases not all an utter incapacity to do a damned thing in the way of effective resistance against such utter shit And here you come to the crux I think It s been going on for a long time and I believe personally that it comes a fusion of two things in the main These are the Cultural Hegemony that has taken hold with such force such threat that it has left many first thinking a sort of well I can t see it I think it s disgusting but they are University people and have degrees in things which I dont so they must know and it must just be me who doesn t understand and secondly the loss via a twisted education system of a sense of pride from National Identity and then personal identity i really believe that having a sense of National Identity taught as a child is a vital part of our development because once you ve developed your sense of self identity you can say I know who I am as can we and others like us and say and I dont accept this under any circumstances It s the rock which gives us the strength to face the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune as Greg Bradden said I can take any circumstance any question flung at me any challenge to me because I know who I am I was part of a Nursing Science staff attendance at a Conference in Melbourne years back At one session there was a lady from NZ flown across to point out what a load of ignorant nothing people we all are because we didn t share ancestral tribal history She talked of how we only recognised two seasons when Aboriginals know of and so forth It went on for an hour She ended by saying she had brought an Aboriginal Tribal Elder with her to make sure she didn t commit cultural trespass then she called for questions Well we d been sitting here being mocked and abused for an hour so I stood up to ask a question merely may i ask who did you bring to make sure you didn t commit cultural trespass against out culture After all it s the culture which provided the airplane that got you here the overhead projector for your presentation the strong brick building with lights and air conditioning in which to give your talk I wonder if you feel maybe you have committed cultural trespass against us My associates were terrified They grabbed hold of me to pull me down to sit they kept hissing No for Gods sake just let it go Why When later over coffee another associate sat down and said why do we put up with this all I could do was look at my colleagues with raised eyebrows And that is why evil like this gets accepted Because most of us have no sense of self identity as a strength and are afraid Afraid of being sent to Coventry Afraid of being hauled up before some Authority figure to explain yourself Maybe afraid of losing future jobs income They cannot yet see that more to be feared is the world we are headed for because we didn t try to stop it out of fear Someone once asked Ayn Rand where she got the courage to speak her beliefs from She replied Its not courage its fear fear of the world we will have if I dont and that I suspect is why just my two pennorth Bro

7922,7922,Several days have passed since that abandoned farm first appeared in Harvest Acres since the slaughtering of those poor toads that had dared go near the field of corn it overlooked and the revelation of the horrible monster that lurked within Since that day several more citizens had vanished from the Life Sphere Their homes emptied with no trace of whoever had lived there Any previous attempt to push into the corn field to find the creature again ending in nothing but more disappearances The police force eventually deciding to close all investigation of the field until a more definitive solution was made It was these circumstances that brought the mage to finally come forward He was used to hiding his power Demacia was notoriously hateful towards magic of any kind Letting even a small bit loose would bring the Mageseekers to his door and chains around his hands But the Life Sphere was different magic was accepted and even practiced by a good chunk of the population And that meant he had no excuse now When the party finally arrived at the designated meeting spot the sun would still be hanging high over Harvest Acres The heat of spring running over the the green grass of the farmland They were standing at the top of hill that overlooked the cornfield It was impossible to see into what was within it even from up here The maize was so thick and tall It seemed almost otherworldly A veritable ocean of bright yellow and green and somewhere deep within it lurked a monster of terrible capabilities One that had already slaughtered dozens if not hundreds in the short span of time it had arrived The mage turned back to the group as they reached the top of the hill His hands clasped tightly over a dark brown book The spine and covers wrapped in jet black tendrils that seemed to almost shift and squirm out of the corner of one s eye He took a deep breath before finally pulling up his hood Revealing a young man likely in his early s messy jet black hair swishing slightly in the wind Thank you all for coming here I can not do this by myself so your help is very much appreciated His gaze turned back to the field as he put the strange tome away His words were rather shaky he did not seem very confident My name is Alcile and the monster that lurks in that field is something from my world As such I wanted to try and take responsibility for it I initially intended to capture the beast and try to use it s powers for the benefit of the Life Sphere He hesitates before finally continuing But I do not even know if the spell I have been preparing can even properly contain it He shook his head he could not think about the negatives right now Instead he reached into his robes and pulled out a large purple gem A small blue rune scrawled across the front of it Bright blue light glowing off the stone as he held it out to the party Regardless if we are even gonna bother trying then you all will need this It s a special crystal from my home world it has all of the mana we will need for the spell I plan to cast but it s only got enough juice to do it once So we are only getting one shot If you find the thing weaken it Beat it to an inch of it s life and force the dark magic it houses to flee When it does raise this stone and aim the beam that ll fire from it If you hit I should be able to handle the rest from here Alcile is giving the party a Catalyst of Aeons This item is only usable in this thread and can only be used by one ally Whoever holds it gets a passive bonus to all Wisdom and Intelligence checks including attacks But also note that carrying this item is a very great responsibility as whoever is wielding it will need to be around in order complete the sub objective of this mission

group of organism those confer health benefit to consumers To be used as probiotic an organism should possess several attributes such as adhesive ability acid and H2O2 production ability bile tolerance and significant antibacterial activity and immunomodulatory activity and must be non pathogenic Microorganisms that are probiotic to humans include yeasts bacilli Escherichia coli enterococci and the more commonly used bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria such as lactobacilli lactococci and streptococci Previous reports involving both In vitro and in vivo studies have indicated that Saccharomyces boulardii is able to prevent intestinal infection caused by Escherichia coli Salmonella typhimurium Staphylococcus aureus Pseudomonas aeruginosa Proteus vulgaris Yersinia enterocolitica and Candida albicans But probiotics properties of Saccharomyces cerevisiae have not been explored that much Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a unicellular yeast and one of the most explored organism in terms of industrial applications and genetic studies Several previous studies showed that members of Saccharomyces genus can possess anti bacterial and probiotic properties Several studies have also been reported with the use of yeasts S boulardii or S cerevisiae as a potential bio therapeutic agent probiotic for the treatment of microbes associated diarrhea and colitis Anti bacterial capability of S cerevisiae might be due to production of extracellular protease secretion of inhibitory proteins stimulation of immunoglobulin A acquisition and elimination of secreted toxins killer toxins sulfur di oxide etc Foods such as milk fermented foods fruits etc are an important source of probiotic Saccharomyces cerevisiae No such study has been performed in Bangladesh to assess the probiotic potential of indigenous Saccharomyces cerevisiae This study aims to determine the probiotic properties of a putative probiotic yeast strain S cerevisiae IFST Methods Isolation and

microorganisms and for long has been used in different biotechnological applications due to its better fermentation capability Besides industrial applications probiotic and health benefit potential of yeast has also been reported in recent times Probiotics are defined as the viable microorganisms that exhibit a beneficial effect on health of the host by improving its intestinal microbial balance S cerevisiae and S boulardii are clinically proven yeasts being used as a human probiotic and has shown to positively influence host s health by antimicrobial effect nutritional effect inactivation of bacterial toxins quorum sensing trophic effects immuno modulatory effects anti inflammatory effects cell restitution and maintenance of epithelial barrier integrity In this study a potential probiotic yeast strain S cerevisiae IFST was isolated from fruit and identified and characterized as Saccharomyces cerevisiae on the basis of morphological and biochemical characteristics and phylogenetic analysis Many other studies reported probiotic yeast isolated from different samples Al Zubaidy and Khidhr also identified Saccharomyces cerevisiae var bouldardii from fruits with probiotic properties antimicrobial activity bile salt and gastric acid tolerance Syal and Vohra reported probiotic attributes of Geotrichum klebahnii a yeast like fungus isolated from cheese To be a successful probiotic any microorganisms must have the capability to be tolerant to stresses that prevail inside human body The isolate can grow in a wide range of temperature and pH while optimum growth at C and pH It also possesses tolerance to bile salt high NaCl simulated gastric juice intestinal environment Œ± amylase trypsin and lysozyme Fig Syal and Vohra reported yeast isolates that can survive in low pH and high bile salt concentration It can produce organic acid and showed resistance against tetracycline ampicillin gentamycin penicillin polymixin B and nalidixic acid The resistance of the yeast strain to antibiotics make it suitable for use in patients undergoing antibiotic treatment Higher resistance to antibiotic provides the yeast strain advantage over bacteria for therapeutic use The isolate pose desirable properties to be a potential probiotic It can assimilate cholesterol can produce killer toxin vitamin B12 glutathione siderophore and strong biofilm Vitamins play key role in numerous metabolic processes of the body and yeasts have been reported to be able to produce vitamins especially vitamin B complex which is a distinctive advantage for yeast to be used as a probiotic over bacteria Dubash et al reported a number of yeast strains belonging to Sachharomyces cerevisiae Candida pintolopesii Candida tropicalis Pichia anomala and Dekkera spp with killer toxin activity It showed moderate auto aggregation ability and cell surface hydrophobicity Auto aggregation and cell surface hydrophobility is very important property of a potential probiotic as these properties are involved in adhesion of the microorganisms to intestinal epithelial cells of patients To provide health benefits to patients by improving nutrient utilization within the intestine a probiotic should have the ability to produce related enzymes The isolate can produce enzymes such as amylase protease lipase cellulose but unable to produce galactosidase The isolate do not produce gelatinase and DNase indicating its safety to be used for human patients as most of the pathogenic microorganisms produce these enzymes as part of their pathogenesis Cholesterol assimilation by yeast with probiotic attributes has also been reported by Chen et al Syal and Vohra reported yeast isolates that showed high auto aggregation ability and cell surface hydrophobicity The isolates were able to produce enzymes such as phytase Œ≤ galactosidase L asparaginase protease and lipase The isolates can produce vitamin B12 and exopolysaccharide The isolates can assimilate cholesterol do not produce DNase and gelatinase Sourabh et al reported probiotic yeast with surface hydrophobicity and autoaggregation One of the most desirable properties of probiotic yeasts is the anti bacterial activity of yeasts against human pathogens The isolate showed moderate anti microbial activity against bacteria and fungi in comparison with standard antibiotic Doxycycline for bacteria and fluconazole for fungi Cell lysate showed better antimicrobial activity than whole cell and culture supernatant Again the isolate showed better anti bacterial activity against gram negative bacteria than gram positive Culture supernatant showed least anti microbial activity indicating that the anti microbial compounds are not extracellular rather cell bound Rajkowska et al reported probiotic yeast strains belonging to S cerevisiae and S boulardii which showed antagonistic activity against human pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes Salmonella typhimurium Pseudomonas aeruginosa Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis Roostita et al reported yeast strains with antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aerugenes Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli Syal and Vohra isolated yeast with antimicrobial activity against E coli Salmonella sp Staphylococcus aureus Vibrio cholerae and Pseudomonas sp Further studies on antimicrobial activity of the yeast isolate against other species of pathogenic bacteria and fungi are needed The isolate showed strong antioxidant activity reducing power nitric oxide and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity significant brine shrimp cytotoxicity and acute toxicity Fig and metal ion chelating activity Table Foligne et al reported yeast possessing significant anti inflammatory activity in mice Antioxidant activity of yeast has also been reported by Chen et al Hassan reported two yeast isolate whose cell autolysates showed antioxidant and immunostimulating activity such as reducing power DPPH radical scavenging nitric oxide scavenging hydroxyl radical scavenging and metal ion chelating activities Sourabh et al reported probiotic yeast with antioxidant properties DPPH free radical scavenging activity and siderophore production ability The isolate also showed strong metal chelating activity an essential property for antioxidant activity Hassan has reported probiotic Saccharomyces cerevisiae with strong metal ion chelating activity Safety assessment is an important criterion to select any potential probiotic for therapeutic applications To assess the safety of S cerevisiae IFST oral toxicity testing in mice was conducted After days of post ingestions period there were no significant differences in behavior or activity of the mice and no diarrheal death No S cerevisiae was detected in blood samples which indicate that the isolate do not pose the ability to infiltrate areas outside the intestine AST level provides a general estimation about any cellular injury occurred as its level increases in case of disease cellular injury On the other hand ALT more specifically indicates liver cell damage higher serum cholesterol Increased ALP has been linked with increased osteoblastic activity lack of bile flow higher serum cholesterol Blood sample analysis also showed that AST ALP and ALT content is almost similar in both treated and control group mice But cholesterol content in treated group mice were lower than control group mice further ensuring the isolate s ability to assimilate cholesterol These observations indicate that the isolate do not induce any gross acute oral toxicity on general health growth and development of mice There were no significant differences in numbers of enterobacteria and S cerevisiae in the feces of treated group and control group mice throughout the day observation period which indicate that the isolate can persist in the intestines Growth rate of the treated group mice was almost similar to that of the control mice There were no significant difference between spleen weight index and liver weight ratio of the treated group and control group mice These results indicate that the isolate cannot induce any systemic infections in mice and is non invasive To test the effect of S cerevisiae IFST062013 on the cellular immune response we examined splenocyte proliferation On day the spleen lymphocyte proliferation capacity was significantly increased in the S cerevisiae treated groups when compared with the ConA control group P < The SI values of the higher dose groups x109 CFU mouse reached their maximum values and were higher than for the moderate dose groups x108 CFU mouse P < On day the results showed a similar trend These results indicate that the probiotic S cerevisiae strain could stimulate a T lymphocyte specific proliferative response and could potentiate humoral immunity and cell mediated immunity and consequently have potential antitumor activity Cytokines play an important role in the development of immune response we evaluated the effect of the strain on the production of pro inflammatory cytokines IFN Œ± and IFN Œ≥ and the anti inflammatory cytokine IL IFN Œ≥induces cell mediated and inflammatory immune responses Our results showed that the probiotic strain simultaneously induced pro and anti inflammatory mediators and consequently helped to maintain a balance between Th1 and Th2 type cytokines which is important for host immunity The probiotic strain modulates gene expression of cytokines in dose dependent manner Fig Conclusion The Saccharomyces cerevisiae IFST isolate showed promising probiotic activities and possessed comparable attributes with other reported probiotic yeasts Continuous screening for selection of probiotic strains with even better attributes should be carried out Before therapeutic application further research should be done to ensure safety and efficiency of the potential probiotic yeast Abbreviation

8745,8745,"LordVic said: ‚Üë No, they're nto wrong to use IOPS. it's just a stat that represents a perspective ideal capability of the device. But, there are always other factors at play, such as how the OS/Software performs it's IO. Latency, device type. type of load, etc. IOPS is great number, but it can be extremely misleading if applied without understanding the whole picture. In my anecdote. While the Nutanix cluster could handle millions of IOPS a second. And via many benchmarks I am able to reproduce. They do their disks writes Asynchronously. As it writes to multiple disks over interconnect, rather than completely local. Because of that, software that requires synchronous disk writes (some database engines) receive a quite noticable latency in their disk IO performance. This resulted in the same database, running near the same parity as 10 year old production hardware. Not a wise investment considering the technological upgrades that would have coincided. I managed to build out a better system, for a fraction of the cost. While it didn't have quite as much IOPS (i don't remember the number I got it too, but I may have overprovisioned. the CPU bottlenecks before storage). It now runs the same back end much faster. Overnight processing down from 8 hours to 2, and backups now take 5 minutes instead of 1 hour! Just pointing out that sometimes, picking the highest number is not always the most beneficial, nor valuable thing to do. In this case, an SSD is tested on Windows 10 which is similar in performance in IOPs to OS X when it comes to random 4k reads. For exmaple, Samsungs EVO 860s have IOPs of 90k (same for WD Blue SSDs). I'm betting Apple is using some form of Toshiba SSD which has comparable perfomance due to controller. Oh, and these are laptops for consumers, not databases or servers; using rated IOPs is fine. It's a limes to lemons comparisson in the end, but it holds true nonetheless."

1741,1741,I love this product for my dry skin! It has helped a lot with my dry patches and eczema and has not caused any irritation. I typically don't like scented products but this one has a very inoffensive smell. It smells rather refreshing in my opinion. Some people are saying it is difficult to be absorbed by their skin but perhaps they are using too much of the product. It absorbs almost immediately for me. A tiny bit in this case goes a very long way due to the low water content. My only gripe is the packaging a plastic squeeze tube would have been better than a tub because I always worry if I'm contaminating the product. If it's a glass tub I understand (easy to recycle) but the tub is plastic anyway why not put it in a tube?

finally faded and folks will want to escape Romance and Erotica writers I know report bang up business right now while everyone else is in the same slowdown It will get better My suggestion once you get your feet under you again is to look for some hobbies that do not necessarily involve staring at a screen for hours You are going to do that anyway and need a break With that in mind I have started sewing again Will post updates as I get farther along in this project The other things I have been doing are also about health and something you should consider We call it The Heresy of Kombucha Or Jun depending Kombucha is a slightly fermented drink made with black tea and sugar Jun is the same thing made with green tea and honey We have been making both The basic recipes are easy if you do not mind being a kombucha heretic And OMG the flame wars and religious schisms on the interwebs about the proper way to make kombucha will turn your hair white Avoid them at all costs This month you are getting a two fer as we talk about homemade redneck Kombucha and homemade elderberry syrup Elderberry syrup is good for you against various diseases mostly flu and cold but anything to keep your immune system sharp right now is a win so adding it regularly to your diet helps Before we got serious with the kombucha I was making Italian sodas with the Sodastream Elderberry syrup some shrubs for flavoring and coconut milk Now I am making kombucha the lazy way and adding Elderberry syrup for a secondary fermentation and life is good So how do we do it Making Your Own Kombucha and then Elderberry Syrup Ingredients oz of loose leaf black tea or bags of regular tea cup hot water from the sink ¬Ω cup of white sugar cups boiling water cup kombucha Directions Get the cup of hot water from the sink and use it to dissolve the sugar in a glass half gallon wide mouth jug While that s working bring the other cups to a boil in the kettle Once the sugar is dissolved hang the tea bags in and then add the boiling water and let everything steep until the water is close to room temperature This is several hours so just leave it on the counter Once the mix is steeped and cool only then do you add the starter kombucha because if you do it otherwise then you might kill your bugs I use unflavored store bought kombucha GT S Original with a blue and white label if that matters to you Pour one cup into the jug and pull out the tea bags Cover the mouth of the jug with several foldings of cheesecloth or something and rubber band it in place The goal is letting air in and keeping insects out You do not need a seal of any kind at this stage Store on the counter in a warm place out of the sun for probably about a week At some point the snot monster will start to form on the top of the liquid This is happy making as it represents fermentation Once you have the start of a snot monster taste the liquid and see if it is done yet YMMV but I like a sweet tartness You will understand When you like the base taste the fun begins Pour off the liquid and try not to get any snot monster in it Or you can remove and discard the snot monster Technically it s called a SCOBY for symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast Some people save them in carefully crafted and maintained Scoby Hotels but that s not my style You can bottle up the current liquid and call it good Just make sure to seal it in an air tight bottle and refrigerate so that most of the bugs die off while drinking it relatively quickly I try to have an inch of so in a glass every day for taste and to help my gut bacteria thrive But here s the fun part SECONDARY FERMENTATION Use something sweet and experiment I normally add maybe a quarter cup of fruit juice to oz of first fermentation kombucha In the past we have done pineapple juice yum clementine juice lemon ginger the wife s favorite and the current hit Elderberry syrup Let it sit on the counter for a couple of days keeping it sealed tight when not drinking Then throw it in the fridge and enjoy A quick note on making Jun instead of Kombucha Substitute Green Tea for Black and Honey for Sugar It also forms a snot monster in only like days instead of a week so play attention and move quickly but everything else is pretty much the same at least when you are a heretical redneck like me When you are ready to make more kombucha I would just go buy another bottle at the grocery story rather than dealing with SCOBY hotels and all that hassle But I am a redneck and a heretic and you can too Now on to the Elderberry Syrup Elderberry Syrup Plus Soda Ingredients cup dried elderberries cups filtered or bottled water clean stuff not tap water unless you are off a good well like me cup honey real stuff made by bees and not that cheap crap with corn syrup and food coloration Spices vary by taste and feel free to experiment slices ginger root ¬Ω lemon or juice cinnamon sticks cloves ¬º cup dried cranberries Put spices and elderberries in pot Add water Bring water to boil while stirring and then simmer for minutes until liquid is reduced by half Pour liquid through strainer mashing berries until all liquid is released Raw or undercooked elderberries can be toxic Strain out all solids and seeds and compost them Let liquid cool to F or less Stir in the honey until dissolved Store in a jar in the refrigerator Italian Soda ¬Ω cup Elderberry syrup tbsp flavored shrub cup carbonated seltzer water ¬º cup coconut milk or cream Mix ingredients in a glass and stir Contents will settle so stir occasionally Stay safe out there

Here are some key tips we went over during her session: ‚úîÔ∏è Keep the flat ironing to a minimum and if you do flat iron or heat style keep the temperature on the lower end. ‚úîÔ∏è Use a hair mask or deep conditioner whenever you use purple shampoo as it is typically very drying on the hair. ‚úîÔ∏è Be wary of conditioning treatments with protein in them because prolonged use (aka keeping it on the hair longer than it specifies on the bottle) can actually lead to it becoming brittle, therefore more breakage. ‚úîÔ∏è Even if you are attached to the length of your hair, it‚Äôs better to cut off the dead ends. Ultimately you won‚Äôt even notice your hair is shorter for the most part, it will actually look thicker and feel SO much better. (We‚Äôre in 2020 ya‚Äôll!!!

1982,1982,"Protective styles are awesome and are the remedy for hair growth. However, there have been certain things that I have done while wearing a protective style that I wish I had done differently. Those are the things that have inspired me to pen this piece for you. Whether you‚Äôre thinking about getting some braids, locs, twists, feed-in braids or any other kind of braid-or-twist-related protective style, if you want them to last, adhere to the following tips below: DO NOT use non-water based product. Ensure you use water-based products like Oleena hair spiritz. That way, it penetrates my hair without caking up as much. It protects your scalp without any flaking or build-up. DO NOT avoid wrapping your hair up at night. It‚Äôs important to wrap up your braids or twists just like you would with your own hair. DO NOT immediately get another protective style. You should wait at least a week or two before putting another one in. Why? It‚Äôs so that you can pamper your natural hair and also give your scalp some time to breathe because it gives you time to truly see what state your hair is naturally in (for instance, do you need a trim or a protein treatment?) so that once you do return to a protective style, you can be confident that your natural hair is in the best shape possible. DO NOT do the same style over and over again.¬†Sometimes people will take out a protective style and see more growth in certain parts of their hair than others. While some of that is due to how fast various sections of their naturally hair grows. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs also a good idea to switch up your kind of protective style¬†and¬†how you style it once you have it. It will take some of the pressure and tension off of your hair, so that once you take your braids or twists out, your natural hair ends up looking better than ever! Know of any other protective style mistakes we might have missed? Share them in the comments!"

10036,10036,It s Evelyn and I m back let s roll My last blog post was in November of last year That s a long time to be away from blogging writing but sometimes we need breaks for clarity s sake Today I ll tell you the happenings which makes this post longer than usual but that s okay I know Google loves longer content anyway I won t disappoint The Corona virus or COVID How are you coping with sheltering in place I m dealing with it exceptionally well as I am an introvert and a homebody However I m starting to get tired of not being able to shop at my favorite stores And the masks are getting to me although I don t wear one that often I m not out that much I keep my distance from others when I m shopping for essentials I wonder if I ll still be standing feet away from others after things are back to normal I m also tired of pinching pennies because the business has almost come to a screeching halt for truckers my husband s profession And when the trucking industry slows down that s when we know things are terrible My prayer is that the nation gets normalcy soon Hannah and Evelyn in Atlanta GA Growing a YouTube Channel Do you know I have a YouTube channel Well I have more than one but I have one that I am working on growing and I finally see a little growth If you re into YouTube check out my channel I upload weekly videos on beauty hair and skin well being and self improvement As for beauty I don t wear make up so you won t see me applying make up My goal is to weave well being physical emotional and social and self improvement topics there as well as on this site YouTube Channel I ve taken training on how to grow on YouTube from two different people And the last class I took was in January which was the best course as well as the most reasonably priced Don t think that since specific training costs more that it must be better because that s not always the case I m enjoying YouTube and what I value the most are the beautiful people I ve met on the platform Connecting with good people makes it easier to let your hair down and be authentic I m Back on Social Media I took a long break from Facebook and Instagram I never left Twitter because it s my favorite social media platform and I ve connected with some fantastic people Since returning to Facebook and Instagram I notice that I don t use the platform as I used to and that s a good thing I took to Twitter a week ago and unfollowed a lot of people because I want to follow fewer people so I can reasonably engage with those on my list Mitch of I m Just Sharing is the one who inspired me to do a Twitter unfollow Blame Mitch if you noticed that I unfollowed you just kidding Twitter Profile Mitch published an article Does the Numbers Game Help You on Social Media which got me thinking about how we fight tooth and nail to have large social media followings but rarely engage These days I d prefer connecting with a few people that I can genuinely engage with then a lot of people who will never engage with me Thanks Mitch for sparking the flame How I Use Social Media I don t get caught up with any negativity online And I see a lot of negativity but I stay away from it People say the meanest things online and I know if they were face to face with the person they would never say what they type online to the other person s face I resigned to keep staying positive and not to get caught up in uncomfortable online discussions Each of us has a choice of how we react to what we see online and I choose to stay calm What will you write Sometimes I have to bite my tongue to not respond to political issues but I have a place online for discussing political topics Although I see people that I follow say things online that I disagree with I rarely reply because I d rather keep the peace than to argue Too much negativity weighs on the spirit and it s stressful If you want peace you are peace If you wish for joy then be a joy If you wish for calmness you must be calm And I can t be a positive light if I let what others say on social media get me fired up It s not worth it Now if we re face to face I might give you a good debate but while online I keep it cute New Direction for my Blog If you re a long time follower of this blog you know I ve made lots of changes over the years and I m still standing Without growth there is no change Growth and change fit well you can t have one without the other I welcome them both I m lightening up and publishing content about whatever I want You ll see blog posts about well being physical emotional and social self improvement hair and skin I plan to incorporate my YouTube channel content here sometimes But I will also let my hair down and let my writing flow more than ever This blog is an extension of my brand and I ll publish content that speaks from my heart to yours Currently I m preparing to launch a business website and write a book The business site is the home for content related to my expertise as a Mind Body Eating Coach and Healthy Gut Advisor I don t have launch dates set but when I m ready to go live you ll be the first to know Step Out on Faith and Just Do It Mailing List for Newsletter I stopped keeping a mailing list to send out newsletters Although I enjoyed it I didn t see why I needed to continue it because most people on my mailing list never opened my emails and no one inquired about working with me I figure I d save my money and time If you want to get my blog posts delivered to your email via Google you can sign up here or add my blog to your favorite RSS Feed Note When I launch my business site and book that s when I ll start a new mailing list One Last Thing I m an Early Riser If you re following me on YouTube or Instagram you know I am committed to being an early riser I m happy to say that I m days in with being an early riser waking at AM It s been tough only because I m a night owl I m learning to adjust Along with rising at AM I ve been journaling the experience and will publish a blog post about it in the future Keep your eyes peeled One thing I m loving about being an early riser is that I get to spend quiet time praying and reading which is a great way to start my day Final Words Thank each of you for being dedicated readers of this blog These days people publish a blog post once a week but that won t be me I ll post more than once a week because I have a lot to say I wish I could publish daily like Seth Godin and maybe I will who knows You ll have to stick around to see Until next time Take care and stay safe The post It s Good to Be Back Now Let s Roll appeared first on Evelyn Parham Written by Evelyn Parham

6846,6846,I did a thread a while back where I picked a random year with a RNG starting from looked up how many PPVs there were that year in all promotions then did another RNG to determine which one I d watch I will do the same format for this thread RNG gives me This page tells me there were major promotion events that year but if there are any I can not get a hold of because they are too obscure I will roll for a different one RNG gives me WCW Fall Brawl War Games Sweet I will watch tonight and update later edit Fall Brawl in Roanoke Virginia starts with a rundown of the card with hilariously campy s Command Conquer style graphics Commentary is Tony Schiavone and Bobby Heenan in a neck brace The commentary table is up against the ring at the heel corner Weird Johnny B Badd vs Lord Steven Regal for the TV title Regal s wrestling technical as always Marc Mero is still wrestling the s style in atomic drops arm wrenches knee lifts He even wins Regal s title with a surprise backslide They mention it s Badd s first singles belt After a recap of Flair and a Masked Man injuring a face Hogan s knee Okerlund shills the WCW HOTLINE The masked man was later revealed as Hulk s best buddy Brother Bruti turning heel I am guessing the hotline did not tell you that Cactus Jack vs Kevin Sullivan Loser Leaves WCW Foley is probably in the best shape of his life here while a beer gutted balding yet mulleted Kevin just looks like somebody s dad Cactus pulls up the floor mat early and then takes a stupid bump from the top to the cement It s a quick match with some Dave Sullivan interference and Jack is gone Foley had been pulling double duty in ECW Eastern pre Extreme so I guess he went back there They keep mentioning that they are so I assume they were beating WWF in ratings here WCW Commissioner Nick Bockwinkel announces that Stunning Steve Austin with hair vs Ricky Steamboat for the US title is canceled due to Steamboat s neck injury too bad I would have liked to see that Steamboat has to forfeit the title to Austin but Austin still has to defend it against Hacksaw Jim Duggan who surprise pins him in seconds This is the worst timeline Security throws out a loudmouth fan at ringside wearing a Blacktop Bully shirt It s Barry Darsow AKA Demolition Smash Repo Man Stars Stripes pre Buff Marcus Bagwell The Patriot vs Pretty Wonderful Paul Roma Paul Orndorff for the Tag Team titles is sort of a mix of old and new styles I am not too familiar with Del Wilkes but he was under the Patriot mask The ref does not see Patriot s hot tag so he s not the legal man for the pin allowing the heels to retain It s weird to see a match end in a clean heel win because the faces were idiots Contender Triangle match Guardian Angel Bossman vs Vader vs Sting This was an absolute booking clusterfuck A Triangle match is a mini tournament where they flip coins and the odd man out sits out for the first singles match then fights the winner First is a Guardian Vader hoss off Vader wins after interference from Harley Race his manager Then they explain the rules of the time limits during the match which the live audience only learns about due to the ring announcer Each of the matches had a minute time limit but the first one did not go that long Sting Vader does Then it goes into minute overtime which ends just as Vader s about to get a pinfall There s still no winner so it goes into Sudden Death which means the first person knocked off his feet loses Harley tries to interfere again so Angel comes back and takes him out Then like a big stupid idiot the ref pushes Race and Angel up the aisle to get them to leave missing Sting taking Vader off his feet The Masked Man takes out Sting and the ref sees Sting down just as Vader gets up and declares Vader the winner What a mess I have no idea who was supposed to look good coming out of this There s a very long segment where they show the entire duration of a phone call between Hogan the champ and Ric Flair not the champ but holding a belt and calling himself the champ Hogan puts his career on the line supposedly meaning he can not wrestle for WCW OR ANYONE ELSE EVER AGAIN The segment drags on and on and it s absolutely filler likely to pad the time Steamboat Austin would have taken Bockwinkel makes it a cage match at Halloween Havoc The Wargames team names are Nasty Dream and The Stud Stable I am not making that up It s Dusty Dustin and the Nasty Boys vs Terry Funk Arn Anderson Bunkhouse Buck and Col Robert Parker Arn and Dustin start and go at it for minutes Heels win the coin toss and Buck is in for the advantage for the next minutes Then it s Saggs Funk Knobs a very reluctant Parker and finally Dusty Boots and belts are used as weapons and it s a chaos brawl It s engaging but there s like no actual wrestling in it Once Dusty gets in for the Match Beyond the faces quickly clear the heels out and beat the poo poo out of Parker who submits to Dusty s Figure Four There s a weird amount of commentator banter post match Like seriously minutes of it It s almost a post show And then there are actual credits rolling I did not realize they did this I wasn t watching WCW at the time Ah OK that makes sense Executive Producer Eric Bischoff That tells me more than any segment could Overall This pretty much sucked Not even really sucked just boring and full of lovely booking There was a TON of padding and less than minutes of wrestling on this hour minute PPV Most of the matches were either really short or too long and featured really odd decisions Even Sting Vader was kind of lame and the booking killed it and Wargames was just heels gain the advantage until the faces all beat up the weakest guy The whole thing seemed like a commercial for Hogan Flair the following month If nothing else at least every match on the card was FOR something There was either a title or a contendership on the line for every undercard match and then the main event was rings men and a cage so that s something too I guess But literally the only match I would have been stoked to see Austin Steamboat was canceled sticklefifer fucked around with this message at on Apr
7247,7247,The very first question that pops up whenever beauty fans begin debating how to trim bangs at home is not really about how it s more of a can you And according to Garnier Consulting Celebrity Stylist Ashley Streicher the answer is yes It is absolutely possible If you trust yourself to do it it can be done Streicher who you may know as the artist behind Mandy Moore s perpetually flawless hair tells TZR over email Mind the wording here though This is about trimming the bangs you already have not cutting new fringe into bang less hair I do not recommend starting fresh and creating a bang Leave that to the professionals Streicher adds Jim Markham CEO and founder of ColorProof Color Care Authority explores this point further Under normal circumstances I would not recommend people trim their bangs at home your stylist will always be able to do a better job he explains If possible I would hold off on new bangs until you can see your stylists Home trims on existing bangs are a lot easier to execute as the framework is already in place And yes there are tricks to properly maintaining that framework Keep on reading to learn exactly how to trim your bangs at home according to these two seasoned pros Prep Your Supplies Precision is absolutely key here and for blunt and curly fringe alike I would stick to very small and very sharp scissors like eyebrow or even cuticle scissors says Streicher Do not use a shaving razor that will fray the ends of your hair and make it very frizzy The small scissors help so that you can only take a little bit at a time which keeps you from lopping off big chunks of hair on accident Trim Your Bangs Dry Although both Streicher and Markham suggest washing your hair first this should be followed up by a thorough dry styling of your bangs into their regular shape as you go I recommend to cut them dry and as you wear them that way you will know exactly how they will lay Streicher says Not only that but trimming your hair while it s dry also can prevent accidental baby bangs Hair shrinks as it dries adds Markham If you cut hair wet you may end up going too short By cutting hair dry you will get a much better idea of your finished length and how the hair will fall Those with curly and coily hair should follow this step too according to Markham Most curly girls already know that their hair will dramatically shrink when it dries I recommend curly girls style their hair as they normally would do either let it dry naturally or with a diffuser prior to trimming he continues Skip The Twist Trim You know that trendy twist cut method that people always bring up when discussing DIY bang trims Yeah do not do that unless you really understand how it ll work with your own hair I do not recommend that method as that doesn t work for everyone s texture Streicher says Folding and twisting techniques can be effective but I prefer point cutting because it gives more accuracy With traditional point cutting you can better predict the results explains Markham And do not manipulate your bang shape either A trick to avoiding cutting bangs too short is to not stretch or pull the hair prior to cutting Let hair fall naturally so you can see where it lays he continues Section Like A Pro Instead pay special attention to sectioning your bangs from the rest of your hair following along with the shape of your previously established fringe This part in trimming your bangs is very important You want to be sure you re not grabbing any extra hair that s not part of your fringe otherwise you will end up with a whole new set of bangs Streicher notes So the easiest part is to only take the short hair that has previously been your bang and pin everything else off the face All Set Here s How To Trim You don t want to cut the entire fringe at the same time or it will look uneven Work in a few thin and horizontal sections starting at the center just below the brow bone at the bridge of your nose If you need to take a bit of weight out of fringe use a point cutting technique where you hold the shears vertically and snip upward into the ends This will eliminate blunt lines Markham says Don t cut straight across And this goes for both fine and thick hair too There is not much difference in the technique However thicker hair is more forgiving than fine hair if you make a mistake Markham adds Knock on wood And What About Curtain Bangs You actually lucked out if you opted for the trendy curtain bang style recently Curtain bangs are an excellent option for times like these when you aren t able to see your stylist The longer style allows bangs to grow out naturally and can easily be styled into a side sweeping bang for versatility says Markham If you have curtain bangs and feel it is time for a trim be sure to take just a little length at a time The best curtain bangs have a few layers that are longer around the face and get shorter he adds Start with where you want the shortest length to be then drop down to the second layer trimming upwards until both layers look blended Continue on How To Take Care Of Fresh Bangs Naturally it does not hurt to give your brand new cut a little extra TLC Use this time to take extra care of your hair Do some masks you can mask as much as you want really says Streicher Though you probably have one or five hair masks on hand already keep scrolling to shop a mix of recommendations from both Streicher Markham and TZR DeepQuench Moisture Masque Take care of those fresh ends by always using sulfate free salt free professional products like ColorProof to gently cleanse and condition while maximizing color retention Once a week incorporate a treatment masque into your routine like DeepQuench Moisture Masque or CrazySmooth Anti Frizz Treatment Masque to replenish moisture strengthen smooth and repair says Markham ColorProofJamaican Black Castor Oil Strengthen the aloe version of this mask alone has more than star reviews on the brand s website Garnier Fructis Leave In Cream With Mango ButterLeave in treatments are a smart choice for hair that needs additional moisture long after you have rinsed out a traditional mask This pick from Klorane is formulated with mango butter and castor oil helping your hair seal in hydration while keeping environmental aggressors out of the equation Klorane

7963,7963,"First up will be uh Wyzzord I think. He's got alchemy poo poo, potentially the whole thing straight out the Karst no problem. So he was supposed to bring in a mandrake root, iron / silver / gold ore. Def got the root. He hands it over and the mousey chick from before keeps a huge portion of it but describes how to split it and make it regenerate. So you lose the mandrake root but get a tiny frag that you plant in a little pot in the Beast's cabin. They want you to grow it back into regular root size. Next up ore assay. You guys picked up three types of ore in the karst, one of which is in significant veins you can go back and mine. Loose ore turned out to be: Silver & Iron! The ore veins you found are lead. Could be worth mining, all raw mats are money in Frigg. rad, now you just need a gold ore for the next phase. pick free rank in herbalism or geology. You can roll it as a skill normally or when you guys rest you can look for raw mats more than normal."
